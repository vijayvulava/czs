<h1>7.2 Anthropogenic Impacts<a class="headerlink" href="#anthropogenic-impacts" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Humans have significantly impacted the Critical Zone (CZ), the delicate layer of Earth’s surface that supports life. Some of the most common human impacts on the CZ include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Deforestation: This refers to clearing trees from an area, which can lead to soil erosion, water pollution, and biodiversity loss.</p></li>
<li><p>Agriculture: While essential for food production, agriculture can negatively affect the CZ. Using fertilizers and pesticides may contaminate soil and water, and clearing land for farming contributes to deforestation.</p></li>
<li><p>Mining: Mining disrupts the natural processes of the CZ. The extraction of minerals can pollute soil and water, and the construction of mines can damage landscapes.</p></li>
<li><p>Urbanization: The growth of cities, or urbanization, often leads to the loss of natural habitats, soil and water contamination, and an increased risk of flooding.</p></li>
<li><p>Climate Change: This global threat significantly impacts the CZ. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns lead to soil erosion, water shortages, and more frequent extreme weather events.</p></li>

<li><p>mitigation strategies for slowing these impacts</p></li>

<section id="deforestation-and-agriculture">
<h2>Deforestation and Agriculture<a class="headerlink" href="#deforestation-and-agriculture" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Agricultural activities, encompassing both crop cultivation and livestock grazing, represent a dominant force reshaping the terrestrial CZ.Croplands and pastures have expanded to the extent that they now rival natural forests as the major biome covering the Earth’s land surface.Globally, over one-third of the world’s land surface and nearly three-quarters of accessible freshwater resources are now dedicated to crop or livestock production. Agricultural land currently spans approximately 38% of the planet’s ice-free land area.</p>
<p>Modern agriculture is often characterized by intensification practices aimed at increasing yields, including the widespread use of synthetic chemical fertilizers (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium), pesticides (herbicides, insecticides, fungicides), extensive irrigation systems, and mechanical tillage. Since the mid-20th century, for instance, global use of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer has increased nearly ninefold, and the amount of water used for irrigation has roughly doubled.</p>
<p>These practices have significant consequences for the CZ. Land conversion for agriculture is the primary driver of habitat loss globally. Agricultural activities contribute substantially to soil degradation through processes like erosion (accelerated by tillage and removal of cover), compaction (from heavy machinery), loss of soil organic matter, and depletion or imbalance of essential nutrients. Agriculture is also a major consumer of water resources through irrigation and a significant source of water pollution via runoff containing excess nutrients and pesticide residues. These impacts collectively alter fundamental biogeochemical cycles within the CZ.</p>
<p>Deforestation, the clearing or significant thinning of forests for conversion to other land uses, is another major anthropogenic pressure on the CZ. The primary driver of deforestation globally is the expansion of agriculture, including clearing land for crops like soy and palm oil, and for cattle ranching. Other significant drivers include logging operations (both legal and illegal) for timber and wood products, the development of infrastructure such as roads and cities, mining activities, and the use of fire, both intentionally for land clearing and unintentionally through wildfires, which can be exacerbated by climate change.</p>
<p>The removal of forest cover has profound impacts on CZ processes. It leads to direct habitat loss and fragmentation, causing significant declines in biodiversity. The loss of protective tree canopy and root systems exposes soil to the direct impact of rain and wind, leading to greatly accelerated soil erosion rates.15 Deforestation disrupts local and regional water cycles by altering evapotranspiration rates and reducing infiltration, often leading to changes in precipitation patterns and river flows, and diminished water quality. Furthermore, forests act as major carbon sinks; their removal not only eliminates this carbon uptake capacity but also releases large amounts of stored carbon into the atmosphere through burning and decomposition, contributing significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions (estimated at 7-10% of the human total) and exacerbating climate change.</p>

</div>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Soil erosion: Trees and their roots help to hold soil in place, and when they are removed, the soil is more susceptible to erosion. This can increase sedimentation in rivers and streams, harming aquatic ecosystems and reducing water quality.</p></li>
<li><p>Changes in the water cycle: Trees play a critical role in the water cycle by intercepting rainfall, reducing runoff, and increasing infiltration. Deforestation can impact these processes, leading to more flooding and droughts and altering the timing and amount of water that reaches streams and rivers.</p></li>
<li><p>Loss of biodiversity: Forests are home to many species of plants and animals, and their removal can lead to biodiversity loss. This can have cascading effects on the CZ, as different species play essential roles in nutrient cycling, pollination, and other ecosystem processes.</p></li>
<li><p>Soil nutrient depletion: Forests play a critical role in cycling nutrients, and their removal can lead to soil nutrient depletion. This can reduce soil fertility and make growing more difficult for plants.</p></li>
<li><p>Increased greenhouse gas emissions: Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in their biomass and soil. Deforestation can increase greenhouse gas emissions, as carbon stored in trees and soils is released into the atmosphere.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Deforestation can significantly impact the CZ, affecting water, soil, biodiversity, and the global climate.</p>

<section id="urbanization">
<h2>Urbanization<a class="headerlink" href="#urbanization" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Urbanization involves the expansion of cities, towns, and associated infrastructure, including residential areas, commercial buildings, industrial facilities, and transportation networks (roads, highways). The global extent of urban areas has more than doubled since the early 1990s. This expansion invariably involves the conversion of natural or agricultural land, leading to habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>
<p>A key impact of urbanization on the CZ is the creation of extensive impervious surfaces (pavement, rooftops), which drastically reduce water infiltration into the soil and significantly increase the volume and rate of surface runoff. This altered hydrology contributes to increased flood risk, reduced groundwater recharge, and changes in stream channel morphology and flow regimes. Urban areas are also major sources of pollution, including municipal and industrial wastewater discharges, contaminants carried in stormwater runoff (heavy metals, hydrocarbons, nutrients, litter), and air pollutants. Soil within urban areas often suffers from sealing, compaction, contamination, and physical disruption. Additionally, the concentration of buildings and paved surfaces creates urban heat islands, modifying local climate, while the overall process of urbanization demands substantial energy and resources, placing considerable stress on the environment.</p>

<h3>Changes in land use<a class="headerlink" href="#changes-in-land-use" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Human-driven land use and land cover (LULC) changes represent one of the most direct and extensive modifications of the Critical Zone. As noted previously, estimates suggest that between 30% and 50% of the global land surface has been transformed by human activities, primarily through the conversion of natural ecosystems like forests and grasslands into agricultural lands (croplands and pastures) and urban settlements. These transformations fundamentally alter the surface characteristics of the CZ, directly influencing key hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration (ET), water infiltration into the soil, and surface runoff generation. They also profoundly impact biogeochemical cycles, particularly those of carbon and nutrients. The soil, acting as the central interface between the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere, plays a critical role in mediating these impacts and transmitting the effects of surface changes throughout the CZ system.</p>

<section id="altered-hydrology">
<h3>Altered hydrology<a class="headerlink" href="#altered-hydrology" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Land use and land cover changes significantly alter the partitioning of precipitation between infiltration into the soil and runoff over the surface. Natural vegetation, particularly forests with extensive root systems and protective litter layers, generally promotes high infiltration rates. Deforestation and conversion to agriculture often lead to reduced infiltration due to soil compaction, loss of soil structure, reduced organic matter, and the absence of deep root channels.3 Conventional tillage, in particular, can create surface crusts and reduce pore continuity, hindering water entry.26 Urbanization has the most dramatic effect, as impervious surfaces like pavement and rooftops essentially eliminate infiltration, forcing nearly all precipitation to become surface runoff. Conversely, practices like afforestation (planting trees) or adopting no-till agriculture with cover crops can enhance infiltration rates.</p>
<p>The consequence of reduced infiltration is a corresponding increase in the volume, rate, and peak flow of surface runoff. Studies modeling future land use scenarios with increased urbanization project significant increases in total surface runoff and streamflow. This shift in hydrology has multiple repercussions: it increases the risk and severity of flooding downstream; it reduces the amount of water recharging underlying aquifers, potentially impacting groundwater availability; it contributes to accelerated soil erosion by increasing the transport capacity of overland flow; and it alters the overall water balance of watersheds. This fundamental alteration of water pathways – shifting from subsurface flow-dominated systems towards surface runoff-dominated systems – is a key consequence of LULC change with cascading effects throughout the CZ.</p>

<section id="soil-degradation">
<h3>Soil degradation<a class="headerlink" href="#soil-degradation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Natural soil formation is an exceedingly slow process, occurring over geological timescales. In contrast, many human land uses, particularly intensive agriculture and urbanization, can lead to rapid soil degradation, defined as a negative trend in land condition expressed as a long-term reduction or loss of biological productivity, ecological integrity, or value to humans.</p>
<p>Agricultural practices are major contributors to soil degradation. Conventional tillage, which involves mechanically disturbing the soil, breaks down soil aggregates, reduces organic matter content, and leaves the soil surface vulnerable. Continuous cultivation without adequate replenishment of organic matter or nutrients can lead to nutrient mining and a decline in soil fertility. Studies comparing agricultural land with natural vegetation often show significant declines in soil organic carbon (SOC) or total organic carbon (TOC), magnesium, boron, iron, and total nitrogen under long-term cultivation.15 Overgrazing by livestock can also lead to soil compaction and loss of vegetative cover, further exacerbating degradation. Urbanization contributes to soil degradation primarily through soil sealing by impervious surfaces (buildings, pavement), which eliminates soil functions entirely in those areas, as well as through compaction during construction and physical disruption of soil profiles.</p>
<p>Soil erosion, the detachment and transport of soil particles by wind or water, is a natural process, but its rate is dramatically accelerated by many human land use practices. The removal of protective vegetation cover, a hallmark of deforestation and conversion to agriculture, leaves the soil surface directly exposed to the erosive forces of rainfall impact and surface runoff. Agricultural tillage disrupts the soil’s natural structure, breaking down aggregates that help resist erosion and reducing surface residue cover that dissipates raindrop energy. Similarly, overgrazing reduces plant cover and trampling compacts the soil, both increasing susceptibility to erosion.</p>
<p>The magnitude of human impact on erosion is substantial. In the United States, soil loss rates on some croplands and pastures have been measured at over 1 centimeter per year, a rate that vastly exceeds natural soil formation rates, leading to a net loss of soil capital. Globally, it has been estimated that roughly half of the planet’s topsoil has been lost over the last 150 years due to erosion and other forms of degradation.Land degradation, with erosion as a key component, currently affects over a quarter of the Earth’s ice-free land area.</p>
<p>The consequences of accelerated erosion are far-reaching. It leads to the loss of fertile topsoil, which contains the bulk of organic matter and nutrients, thereby reducing agricultural productivity and potentially threatening food security. The eroded sediment is transported into streams, rivers, and lakes, causing sedimentation that clogs waterways, degrades aquatic habitats, and reduces water storage capacity in reservoirs. Eroded sediment often carries attached pollutants, such as nutrients (phosphorus) and pesticides, further impairing water quality.</p>

<section id="changes-in-biogeochemical-cycling">
<h3>Changes in biogeochemical cycling<a class="headerlink" href="#changes-in-biogeochemical-cycling" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Natural ecosystems typically exhibit relatively closed nutrient cycles, where nutrients taken up by plants are returned to the soil through litter decomposition. Land use changes disrupt these cycles profoundly. Deforestation removes the significant nutrient pool held in biomass and eliminates the continuous input of nutrients via litterfall. Increased runoff following deforestation can also flush nutrients out of the system.</p>
<p>Agriculture fundamentally alters nutrient cycling through the removal of nutrients in harvested crops and the addition of external inputs like synthetic fertilizers and manures. Continuous cropping without adequate nutrient replacement or fallow periods can lead to the depletion or “mining” of soil nutrient stocks, including essential macro- and micronutrients. Conversely, the overuse or inefficient management of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizers often leads to nutrient surpluses in the soil. These excess nutrients can cause soil acidification (associated with some nitrogen fertilizers), create imbalances that affect plant uptake of other nutrients, and are readily lost to the environment via runoff and leaching.</p>
<p>The consequences of disrupted nutrient cycles include declines in soil fertility and long-term agricultural productivity due to the loss of organic matter and essential elements. Nutrient losses from agricultural and urban landscapes are a primary cause of eutrophication in downstream aquatic ecosystems, leading to harmful algal blooms, oxygen depletion (hypoxia or “dead zones”), fish kills, and loss of biodiversity. Land use change, particularly through agriculture, is recognized as a critical driver altering global nutrient cycles, with significant environmental repercussions. The health of the soil itself, including its structure, organic matter content, and microbial communities, is central to regulating these processes. Practices that degrade soil health simultaneously exacerbate erosion, reduce infiltration, and disrupt nutrient cycling, while soil-building practices offer co-benefits across these functions. Furthermore, the impacts of LULC are often persistent, creating legacy effects that influence CZ structure, function, and resilience long after the initial change, making degraded systems more vulnerable to future disturbances like climate change.</p>

<section id="heat-island-effects">
<h3>Heat island effects<a class="headerlink" href="#heat-island-effects" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Urbanization can increase city temperatures, as buildings and pavement absorb and retain heat. This can negatively impact human health and the environment, such as increased air pollution and energy consumption.</p>
<p>Overall, the impacts of urbanization on the CZ depend on various factors, including the type of development, the location, and the surrounding natural ecosystems. However, urbanization can have significant and long-lasting effects on the CZ.</p>

<section id="climate-change">
<h2>Climate Change<a class="headerlink" href="#climate-change" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>There is unequivocal scientific consensus that the Earth’s climate system is warming, and that human activities are the dominant cause. The primary driver is the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs)—principally carbon dioxide (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ce{CO2}\)</span>), methane (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ce{CH4}\)</span>), and nitrous oxide (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ce{N2O}\)</span>)—resulting from the burning of fossil fuels for energy and transportation, industrial processes, deforestation, and agricultural practices. Since the pre-industrial period (roughly 1850-1900), these activities have caused global average surface temperature to increase by approximately 1.1°C (as of 2011-2020). Atmospheric concentrations of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ce{CO2}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ce{CH4}\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ce{N2O}\)</span> have reached levels unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years.</p>
<p>Importantly, warming is not uniform across the globe; land areas are warming significantly faster than the global average, particularly in high-latitude regions. Climate models project continued warming throughout the 21st century under all emission scenarios, with global temperature expected to reach or exceed 1.5°C of warming above pre-industrial levels within the coming decades. Climate change, however, encompasses far more than just rising average temperatures. It involves fundamental shifts in the climate system, including alterations in precipitation patterns (amount, intensity, seasonality), an intensification of the global water cycle, more frequent and intense extreme weather events (heat waves, heavy rainfall, droughts), rising sea levels, and widespread changes in the cryosphere (glaciers, snow cover, permafrost). These pervasive changes act as powerful modifiers of Critical Zone processes worldwide.</p>

<p>One of the most significant impacts of climate change on the CZ (climate zone) is the alteration of precipitation patterns. As the climate warms, some regions are experiencing more intense rainfall events, while others face prolonged droughts. These changes can affect soil erosion rates, nutrient cycling, and water availability, all of which influence the health and productivity of ecosystems in the CZ.</p>
<p>Climate change can also reshape vegetation cover in the CZ. Variations in temperature and precipitation can shift the ranges of plant species, with some plants being better adapted to the new climate conditions than others. This shift can lead to changes in the composition and productivity of vegetation in the CZ, further affecting other ecological processes.</p>
<p>Moreover, climate change can disrupt biogeochemical cycles within the CZ. For instance, changes in temperature and precipitation can influence nutrient cycling and carbon storage rates, ultimately impacting the overall health and productivity of the ecosystem. These effects can significantly threaten the long-term sustainability of the CZ and the ecosystem services it provides to humans, including clean water and food production.</p>

<section id="the-anthropocene">
<h2>The Anthropocene<a class="headerlink" href="#the-anthropocene" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The term “Anthropocene” gained significant traction in the scientific community and beyond. The term was coined by Nobel Prize-winning chemist Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer (<a class="reference external" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-82202-6_2">see The ‘Anthropocene’ (2000) | SpringerLink</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/415023a">Geology of mankind</a>). While the term itself was coined earlier, it was Crutzen and Stoermer’s proposal that humanity had entered a new geological epoch due to its profound impact on the planet that resonated widely. The core idea behind the Anthropocene is that human activities have become the primary driver shaping the Earth’s systems, to such an extent that they now rival the forces of natural geophysical processes. This influence has intensified significantly since the mid-20th century, a period often referred to as the “Great Acceleration,” marked by an unprecedented surge in population growth, industrialization, and globalization. See</p>
<p>The Anthropocene is a proposed geological epoch that marks the impact of human activities on Earth’s geology and ecosystems. It is characterized by the significant changes in the Earth’s geology and ecosystems caused by human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and climate change.  The Anthropocene era is still a topic of debate among scientists and geologists.</p>

<p>The formalization of the Anthropocene as a geological epoch by the ICS has been a subject of considerable debate. The Anthropocene Working Group (AWG), tasked with evaluating the evidence, proposed a start date around 1950 CE, using the sharp upturn in plutonium levels resulting from nuclear weapons testing as a primary marker. However, in March 2024, the ICS Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) voted against this proposal, a decision later confirmed by the ICS and the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS). The rejection was largely attributed to concerns about the relatively shallow sedimentary record associated with such a recent start date and whether the proposed marker met the stringent criteria for defining a new epoch. An alternative perspective suggests defining the Anthropocene not as a formal epoch but as an ongoing “geological event,” which might better reflect the complex and potentially diachronous nature of human impacts.</p>
<p>The critical zone, defined as the Earth’s permeable near-surface layer “from the tops of the trees to the bottom of the groundwater,” is profoundly affected by the Anthropocene. The Anthropocene era is defined within the context of the critical zone in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Dominant Human Influence: The defining characteristic of the Anthropocene in the critical zone is the overwhelming impact of human activities on its composition, structure, and functioning. Natural processes within the critical zone are now inextricably linked with and often overridden by anthropogenic forces.</p></li>
<li><p>Key Anthropogenic Drivers and Their Impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Land-use Change: Activities like agriculture, deforestation, urbanization, and mining drastically alter the physical structure of the critical zone. This leads to soil erosion, habitat fragmentation, changes in water infiltration and storage, and altered biogeochemical cycles.</p></li>
<li><p>Climate Change: Human-induced climate change affects temperature and precipitation patterns, leading to altered weathering rates, changes in vegetation cover, increased frequency of extreme events (like droughts and floods), and impacts on water availability within the critical zone.</p></li>
<li><p>Pollution: The introduction of various pollutants (e.g., heavy metals, pesticides, plastics, industrial chemicals) into the atmosphere, water, and soil directly contaminates the critical zone, affecting its biological and chemical processes and threatening the health of ecosystems and human populations.</p></li>
<li><p>Altered Biogeochemical Cycles: Human activities, particularly the industrial fixation of nitrogen and the burning of fossil fuels, have significantly altered global nutrient cycles (nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon). This leads to eutrophication of water bodies, soil acidification, and changes in atmospheric composition, all of which cascade through the critical zone.</p></li>
<li><p>Biodiversity Loss: Habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change driven by human actions are causing unprecedented rates of biodiversity loss within the critical zone, weakening ecosystem resilience and altering critical zone processes.</p></li>
<li><p>Geomorphic Changes: Human activities such as dam construction, river channelization, and large-scale excavation have become significant geomorphic agents, rivaling or exceeding natural rates of erosion and sedimentation within the critical zone.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The “Anthropogenic Critical Zone”: Recognizing the profound and pervasive influence of humans, the concept of the “Anthropogenic Critical Zone” has emerged. This perspective emphasizes the need to study the critical zone not as a purely natural system but as one deeply intertwined with human activities and the “technosphere” (human-built infrastructure and technology).</p>
<section id="implications-for-critical-zone-science">
<h3>Implications for Critical Zone Science:<a class="headerlink" href="#implications-for-critical-zone-science" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Critical zone science in the Anthropocene requires a transdisciplinary approach, integrating knowledge from earth sciences, ecology, social sciences, and the humanities to understand the complex interactions between human actions and critical zone processes.</p>
<p>Research focuses on quantifying the impacts of human activities on critical zone fluxes (water, carbon, nutrients, sediment) and understanding how these changes affect essential ecosystem services like food production, water quality, and carbon sequestration.</p>
<p>There is a growing emphasis on incorporating human agency and local knowledge into critical zone research and management to address environmental challenges effectively.</p>
<p>In essence, the Anthropocene defines a state where the critical zone’s development, function, and future trajectory are no longer governed primarily by natural forces but are increasingly shaped by human activities, demanding a new paradigm for understanding and managing this life-sustaining layer of our planet.</p>

<section id="the-anthrocene-epoch">
<h3>The Anthrocene Epoch<a class="headerlink" href="#the-anthrocene-epoch" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The Anthropocene is NOT yet formally recognized as an official epoch within the Geologic Time Scale by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS). While the term is widely used informally in scientific and public discourse, the geological community is still debating its formal definition, start date, and whether it meets the criteria for a distinct epoch.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Proposed Start Date: The Anthropocene Working Group (AWG), which advocated for its formalization, proposed a start date around 1950 CE. This coincides with a period known as the “Great Acceleration,” marked by significant increases in human population, industrial activity, resource consumption, and environmental impact, including the presence of nuclear fallout in geological strata.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternative Proposed Dates: While 1950 is a leading proposal, other start dates have been suggested, ranging from the beginning of agriculture to the Industrial Revolution.</p></li>
<li><p>“Golden Spike”: The AWG proposed Crawford Lake in Canada as the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), or “golden spike,” to mark the beginning of the Anthropocene in the geological record, characterized by specific markers in the lake sediments dating to around 1950.  However, this proposal was ultimately rejected in a formal vote.  See <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1177/20530196221149281">McCarthy et al, 2023</a> for the evidence presented in support of the “golden spike.”</p></li>
