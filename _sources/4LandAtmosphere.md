# 4 Land-Atmosphere Exchange

In this module we will analyze how energy and carbon flow through the CZ and how they drive CZ processes. We will learn how to analyze data and use simple models to interpret spatial and temporal trends in energy flow and reservoirs at a catchment scale to answer questions about CZ processes.

As you are studying interactions between Earth's surface and the atmosphere, consider how you will 
- trace primary radiative forcings through the CZ using data derived from field sites,
- use micro-meteorological data to describe the differences between the main atmospheric fluxes at different CZ regions,
- relate carbon flux data collected at various scales to understand the regional exchange of carbon, and
- analyze how energy, carbon, and nutrients flow through the CZ and drive CZ processes.


## Goals of the Module

**Overarching Learning Objective:**Â Describe and characterize how interaction among the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and soil (The CZ) support and influence life.
- Unit 4.1: The use of water and energy budgets and mass/energy conservation are both ways that scientists evaluate their understanding of the interactions among different systems and are the main topics of this unit.
- Unit 4.2: The use of carbon budgets and mass conservation are both ways that scientists evaluate their understanding of the interactions among different systems and are the main topics of this unit.
