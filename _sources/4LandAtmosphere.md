# 4 Land-Atmosphere Exchange

This module will explore the movement of energy and carbon within the critical zone (CZ) and how these processes influence the CZ itself. We will investigate methods for analyzing data and applying basic models to understand spatial and temporal patterns in energy flow and reservoirs at the catchment level. Our goal is to address inquiries related to critical zone processes.

As we examine the interactions between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere, consider the following points:
- Track primary radiative forcings throughout the critical zone by utilizing data obtained from field locations.
- Use micro-meteorological data to explain variations in key atmospheric fluxes across different areas of the critical zone.
- Connect carbon flux data collected at various scales to gain insight into regional carbon exchange.
- Examine how energy, carbon, and nutrients circulate through the critical zone and influence its processes.

## Goals of the Module

**Overarching Learning Objective:** Explain and define how the interactions among the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and soil (the critical zone) support and affect life.
- Unit 4.1: Water and energy budgets, along with mass and energy conservation, are methods that scientists use to assess their understanding of interactions among various systems. These are the primary subjects of this unit.
- Unit 4.2: Carbon budgets and mass conservation are approaches scientists apply to evaluate their understanding of interactions among different systems, which are the key topics of this unit.
