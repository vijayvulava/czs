# 1.2 The Role of Soil

Soil comprises mineral and organic matter sourced from various origins, which are crucial in sustaining life on Earth, including human society. Soils are not randomly distributed; instead, they occupy spaces influenced by the overlapping factors of soil formation. Ultimately, soil demonstrates the interplay of atmospheric, lithospheric, hydrologic, and biological processes, reflecting the intricate workings of the Critical Zone (CZ).

We will use online resources to examine the distribution of soils at a site of your choosing and consider how this distribution aids our understanding of CZ processes and land use at that location.

The function of the CZ is characterized by interconnected physical, biological, and chemical processes, which are studied by experts in various fields such as geology, soil science, biology, ecology, geochemistry, geomorphology, and hydrology, among others.

The soil CZ concept is perhaps best illustrated by a four-leaf clover-like emblem of yellow (at the top, representing atmosphere), green (right, biosphere), blue (left, hydrosphere), and brown (bottom, lithosphere) arcs surrounding the acronym SoilCritZone; the design of the logo symbolizes how soil and the CZ exist within the overlapping region between the four arcs or "spheres."
```

While these disciplines are equally crucial for understanding the CZ, they are linked by the presence of soil, which many consider the central component of the CZ. This concept is illustrated by a four-leaf clover-like emblem in {numref}`soil-crit-zone`.  The spheres shown in {numref}`soil-crit-zone` closely overlap with the state factors of soil formation you will be introduced to later in this lesson: parent material, climate, topography, biota, and age.

## Definitions of Soil

When discussing soil, it is essential to consider various aspects, including the following four definitions:

1. Soil is the upper layer of the Earth that can be dug or plowed, where plants grow. It refers to the superficial, unconsolidated, and usually weathered part of a planet's mantle, especially on Earth ([Soil Definition & Meaning - Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soil)).   
2. Soil is defined as earth material altered by physical, chemical, and biological agents, allowing it to support upright, rooted plants. Engineers include all regolith in this definition as well ([Glossary of Geology | American Geosciences Institute](https://www.americangeosciences.org/pubs/glossary#online)).
3. (i) Soil refers to the unconsolidated mineral or organic material on the Earth's surface that is a natural medium for land plants' growth. (ii) It is also the unconsolidated mineral or organic matter that has been affected by various genetic and environmental factors, such as climate (including the effects of water and temperature) and macro- and microorganisms shaped by the landscape and acting on parent material over time. A product-soil exhibits different physical, chemical, biological, and morphological properties compared to the material from which it is derived ([Glossary of Soil Science Terms | Soil Science Society of America](https://www.soils.org/publications/soils-glossary/)).
4. Soil is the naturally occurring, loose covering of broken rock particles and decaying organic matter (known as humus) on the Earth's surface, capable of supporting life. In simple terms, soil consists of three components: solid, liquid, and gas. The solid phase is a mixture of mineral and organic matter, which forms a loose structure filled with voids. The solid phase accounts for about half of the soil's volume, while the remaining space contains water (liquid) and air (gas). Soil is often referred to as earth, which is the substance from which our planet derives its name ([Soil - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil)).

While these four definitions share common elements, they also differ in focus. Agronomists and most soil scientists emphasize the study of the rooted zone or rhizosphere (approximately to a depth of one meter). In contrast, geologists take a broader and deeper view, examining material down to the original parent material, which can reach depths of up to one hundred meters or more. Most scientists agree that soil is a complex biomaterial that supports the growth of terrestrial organisms and is vital for life on Earth. It results from the weathering of parent material, the decomposition of plant matter, and atmospheric deposition. Since soil resources are finite, humanity must recognize their non-sustainable nature and learn to care for and sustain these essential resources. This unit focuses on soil, the "heart" of the Critical Zone (CZ).

## Soil Background

When examining a soil pit or a roadside cut, you will notice different layers within the soil known as **soil horizons**. The arrangement of these horizons within a particular soil is referred to as a **soil profile**. Soil scientists, also known as pedologists, study and describe soil profiles and horizons to classify and interpret soil for various applications.

Soil horizons vary in several observable properties, including color, texture, structure, and thickness. However, some properties are less visible. For instance, chemical and mineral content, consistency, and reactivity require specific laboratory tests. All of these properties are essential for defining different types of soil horizons.

Soil scientists use capital letters **O**, **A**, **B**, **C**, and **E** to denote the master horizons, while lowercase letters are used for distinctions within these horizons. Most soils possess three main horizons: the surface horizon (**A**), the subsoil (**B**), and the substratum (**C**). Some soils may also feature an organic horizon (**O**) at the surface, although this horizon can sometimes be buried. The master horizon **E** signifies subsurface horizons that have experienced significant mineral loss, a process known as eluviation. Hard bedrock, classified separately from soil, is represented by the letter **R**.

## Soil Formation

Soil formation, or pedogenesis, occurs over millennial time scales. The "mineral" components of soil are formed from rocks and minerals' physical and chemical weathering. Soil formation is controlled by five variables in nature, represented by the equation below:

$$
\text{Soil/Ecosystems}=f(Cl,O,R,P,T,...)
$$
where, $Cl$ is climate, $O$ is organisms, $R$ is topographic relief, $P$ is parent material, and $T$ is time.   The soil-forming factors have these important characteristics: (1) they are independent of the system (soil/ecosystems) being studied, and (2) in many parts of the Earth, the state factors ($Cl$, $O$, $R$, $P$, $T$, etc.) vary independently of each other. 

The rate of soil formation can be expressed in differential form as

$$
dS=\frac{\partial S}{\partial Cl}dCl + \frac{\partial S}{\partial O}d O + \frac{\partial S}{\partial R}dR + \frac{\partial S}{\partial P}dP + \frac{\partial S}{\partial T}dT
$$

While this differential form is not precisely quantitative, it gives us an idea of which variable(s) is likely dominant in any given setting.

````

The soil formation rates have not been as thoroughly characterized as erosion. This creates a challenging situation for scientists and land-use planners concerned about soil erosion's impacts. While we know that there are locations on Earth where soil is eroding at unsustainable rates, it raises the question: are there sites where soil forms at a rate that equals or exceeds the erosion rate? If such sites exist, soil erosion may not be a significant concern for land-use decisions in those areas. Therefore, accurately determining soil formation rates under various conditions is critical in critical zone science.

Additionally, many scientists recognize that human activity has greatly influenced much of the critical zone, representing a sixth factor in soil formation. The varying distribution of these factors, known as state factors, across the Earthâ€™s surface leads to differences in soil development's physical, chemical, and biological processes. This variability plays a significant role in soil formation and the emergence of different soil types.

In the videos below, Professor John Graveel of Purdue University discusses soil formation and properties.

## Soil Orders

Due to the diverse climates, geography, and geology, soils develop unique characteristics that reflect their local regions. Soil scientists have created a system to classify and name soils, known as ***soil taxonomy***. Soils are classified as natural entities based on the characteristics of their profiles.

</div>

There are 12 major soil orders worldwide represent broad climate types and soil development processes. Within each order, there are multiple suborders. To learn more about these major orders, visit [The Twelve Orders of Soil Taxonomy | Natural Resources Conservation Service (usda.gov)](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/resources/education-and-teaching-materials/the-twelve-orders-of-soil-taxonomy). 

Soil suborders are subdivisions of soil orders based on specific characteristics that reflect soil formation processes or environmental conditions. Each order comprises several suborders, and the name of a suborder typically ends with a suffix indicating the order it belongs to. For example, the suborders of Alfisols (soils rich in aluminum and iron) end with the suffix -alf, such as [Aqualfs, Udalfs, Ustalfs, and Xeralfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USDA_soil_taxonomy). 

The criteria for defining soil suborders vary depending on the order. Still, we generally consider soil moisture regime, soil temperature regime, horizon development, clay mineralogy, organic matter content, and parent material. Some soil suborders are more widespread than others, depending on the geographic distribution of the soil orders and the environmental factors that influence soil formation. For instance, Ultisols (soils with low base saturation and high weathering) are primarily found in humid regions such as the southeastern United States, parts of South America, Africa, and Asia. They are divided into five suborders: [Aquults, Humults, Udults, Ustults, and Xerults](https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/soil-orders/ultisols). Aquults are Ultisols with a water table at or near the surface for extended periods during the year, while Xerults are Ultisols that experience a four to six months dry season. 

**State soils** are soils that hold special significance for particular states. Each state in the United States has designated a state soil, with twenty of these selections established legislatively. To learn more, visit [State Soils | Natural Resources Conservation Service (usda.gov)](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/resources/education-and-teaching-materials/state-soils). 

The USDA-NRCS maintains a soil map of the United States at [Web Soil Survey (usda.gov)](https://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/WebSoilSurvey.aspx). Navigate to this site to learn how to generate a soil report for your area of interest. It's not the most intuitive site, so watch the video to help create a soil report for your specific location.

## Soil Erosion

Soil erosion is the removal of the upper layers of soil due to various natural and anthropogenic causes. Since the upper layers tend to have higher organic matter and nutrients, erosion can cause significant negative impacts on agriculture and water pollution. An inch of soil may take a thousand years to build but could be removed in one rainstorm. Thin layers of soil on top of shallow bedrock and frequently tilled soils are particularly sensitive, as erosion may lead to a loss of agricultural productivity.  Excessive erosion leads to an environmental disaster called desertification [Desertification | UNCCD](https://www.unccd.int/land-and-life/desertification/overview). See the simple demonstration below on soil health.

There is a growing movement focusing on holistic management of soil and regenerative agriculture, as described in the video below.

What aspects of the cultural zone (CZ), besides soil, are affected by soil erosion and other threats to soils? Are these impacts beneficial or harmful? For instance, while the erosion of weathered material can deplete the soil, the transport and deposition of those particles contribute to the gradual formation of floodplains and deltas in other areas. Additionally, moderate soil erosion can introduce nutrients into the water cycle, which various organisms depend on to survive and thrive.
