# 7.2 Climate Change Impacts

Humans have significantly impacted the Critical Zone (CZ), the delicate layer of Earth's surface that supports life. Some of the most common human impacts on the CZ include:

- **Deforestation:** This refers to clearing trees from an area, which can lead to soil erosion, water pollution, and biodiversity loss.
  
- **Agriculture:** While essential for food production, agriculture can negatively affect the CZ. Using fertilizers and pesticides may contaminate soil and water, and clearing land for farming contributes to deforestation.
  
- **Mining:** Mining disrupts the natural processes of the CZ. The extraction of minerals can pollute soil and water, and the construction of mines can damage landscapes.
  
- **Urbanization:** The growth of cities, or urbanization, often leads to the loss of natural habitats, soil and water contamination, and an increased risk of flooding.
  
- **Climate Change:** This global threat significantly impacts the CZ. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns lead to soil erosion, water shortages, and more frequent extreme weather events.

The Anthropocene is a proposed geological epoch that marks the impact of human activities on Earth’s geology and ecosystems. It is characterized by the significant changes in the Earth’s geology and ecosystems caused by human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and climate change. The term was coined by Nobel Prize-winning chemist Paul Crutzen ([see The ‘Anthropocene’ (2000) | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-82202-6_2)). The Anthropocene era is still a topic of debate among scientists and geologists.

There is no consensus on when the Anthropocene era began, but there is some consensus that humans are agents of geologic change.

In this section, you will:
- learn about the impacts that humans have on the CZ,
- the different types of impacts, and 
- mitigation strategies for slowing these impacts


## Deforestation and Agriculture

Deforestation can have significant impacts on the CZ.

### Soil erosion
Trees and their roots help to hold soil in place, and when they are removed, the soil is more susceptible to erosion. This can increase sedimentation in rivers and streams, harming aquatic ecosystems and reducing water quality.

### Changes in the water cycle
Trees play a critical role in the water cycle by intercepting rainfall, reducing runoff, and increasing infiltration. Deforestation can impact these processes, leading to more flooding and droughts and altering the timing and amount of water that reaches streams and rivers.

### Loss of biodiversity
Forests are home to many species of plants and animals, and their removal can lead to biodiversity loss. This can have cascading effects on the CZ, as different species play essential roles in nutrient cycling, pollination, and other ecosystem processes.

### Soil nutrient depletion
Forests play a critical role in cycling nutrients, and their removal can lead to soil nutrient depletion. This can reduce soil fertility and make growing more difficult for plants.

### Increased greenhouse gas emissions
Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in their biomass and soil. Deforestation can increase greenhouse gas emissions, as carbon stored in trees and soils is released into the atmosphere.

Deforestation can significantly impact the CZ, affecting water, soil, biodiversity, and the global climate.


## Urbanization

Urbanization can significantly impact the CZ, the thin layer of Earth's surface where rock, soil, water, air, and living organisms interact.

### Changes in land use
Urbanization often involves converting natural land cover, such as forests and grasslands, into built-up areas like roads, buildings, and parking lots. This can alter the water and nutrient cycling balance and reduce habitat availability for organisms that rely on natural ecosystems.

### Altered hydrology
As natural landscapes are converted to impervious surfaces, such as concrete and asphalt, the ability of water to infiltrate the soil is reduced, leading to increased surface runoff and erosion. This can cause changes in stream flow and water quality downstream and increase flood risk.

### Soil compaction
Heavy machinery and foot traffic associated with urbanization can lead to soil compaction, which reduces the ability of the soil to hold water and support plant growth.  


### Changes in biogeochemical cycling

Urbanization can alter the CZ's cycling of nutrients and other chemicals, such as carbon and nitrogen. For example, increased use of fertilizers and other chemicals in urban landscapes can lead to elevated nutrient concentrations in streams and groundwater.

### Heat island effects
Urbanization can increase city temperatures, as buildings and pavement absorb and retain heat. This can negatively impact human health and the environment, such as increased air pollution and energy consumption.

Overall, the impacts of urbanization on the CZ depend on various factors, including the type of development, the location, and the surrounding natural ecosystems. However, urbanization can have significant and long-lasting effects on the CZ.

## Climate Change

Climate change significantly impacts the CZ, particularly in altering the water cycle and affecting soil and vegetation.

One of the most significant impacts of climate change on the CZ (climate zone) is the alteration of precipitation patterns. As the climate warms, some regions are experiencing more intense rainfall events, while others face prolonged droughts. These changes can affect soil erosion rates, nutrient cycling, and water availability, all of which influence the health and productivity of ecosystems in the CZ.

Climate change can also reshape vegetation cover in the CZ. Variations in temperature and precipitation can shift the ranges of plant species, with some plants being better adapted to the new climate conditions than others. This shift can lead to changes in the composition and productivity of vegetation in the CZ, further affecting other ecological processes.

Moreover, climate change can disrupt biogeochemical cycles within the CZ. For instance, changes in temperature and precipitation can influence nutrient cycling and carbon storage rates, ultimately impacting the overall health and productivity of the ecosystem. These effects can significantly threaten the long-term sustainability of the CZ and the ecosystem services it provides to humans, including clean water and food production.
