# 7.2 Climate Change Impacts

Humans have significantly impacted the Critical Zone (CZ), the delicate layer of Earth's surface that supports life. Some of the most common human impacts on the CZ include:

- **Deforestation:** This refers to clearing trees from an area, which can lead to soil erosion, water pollution, and biodiversity loss.
  
- **Agriculture:** While essential for food production, agriculture can negatively affect the CZ. Using fertilizers and pesticides may contaminate soil and water, and clearing land for farming contributes to deforestation.
  
- **Mining:** Mining disrupts the natural processes of the CZ. The extraction of minerals can pollute soil and water, and the construction of mines can damage landscapes.
  
- **Urbanization:** The growth of cities, or urbanization, often leads to the loss of natural habitats, soil and water contamination, and an increased risk of flooding.
  
- **Climate Change:** This global threat significantly impacts the CZ. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns lead to soil erosion, water shortages, and more frequent extreme weather events.

### Soil erosion
Trees and their roots help to hold soil in place, and when they are removed, the soil is more susceptible to erosion. This can increase sedimentation in rivers and streams, harming aquatic ecosystems and reducing water quality.

### Changes in the water cycle
Trees play a critical role in the water cycle by intercepting rainfall, reducing runoff, and increasing infiltration. Deforestation can impact these processes, leading to more flooding and droughts and altering the timing and amount of water that reaches streams and rivers.

### Loss of biodiversity
Forests are home to many species of plants and animals, and their removal can lead to biodiversity loss. This can have cascading effects on the CZ, as different species play essential roles in nutrient cycling, pollination, and other ecosystem processes.

### Soil nutrient depletion
Forests play a critical role in cycling nutrients, and their removal can lead to soil nutrient depletion. This can reduce soil fertility and make growing more difficult for plants.

### Increased greenhouse gas emissions
Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in their biomass and soil. Deforestation can increase greenhouse gas emissions, as carbon stored in trees and soils is released into the atmosphere.

Deforestation can significantly impact the CZ, affecting water, soil, biodiversity, and the global climate.


## Urbanization

Urbanization can significantly impact the CZ, the thin layer of Earth's surface where rock, soil, water, air, and living organisms interact.

### Changes in land use
Urbanization often involves converting natural land cover, such as forests and grasslands, into built-up areas like roads, buildings, and parking lots. This can alter the water and nutrient cycling balance and reduce habitat availability for organisms that rely on natural ecosystems.

### Altered hydrology
As natural landscapes are converted to impervious surfaces, such as concrete and asphalt, the ability of water to infiltrate the soil is reduced, leading to increased surface runoff and erosion. This can cause changes in stream flow and water quality downstream and increase flood risk.

### Soil compaction
Heavy machinery and foot traffic associated with urbanization can lead to soil compaction, which reduces the ability of the soil to hold water and support plant growth.  


### Changes in biogeochemical cycling

Urbanization can alter the CZ's cycling of nutrients and other chemicals, such as carbon and nitrogen. For example, increased use of fertilizers and other chemicals in urban landscapes can lead to elevated nutrient concentrations in streams and groundwater.

### Heat island effects
Urbanization can increase city temperatures, as buildings and pavement absorb and retain heat. This can negatively impact human health and the environment, such as increased air pollution and energy consumption.

Overall, the impacts of urbanization on the CZ depend on various factors, including the type of development, the location, and the surrounding natural ecosystems. However, urbanization can have significant and long-lasting effects on the CZ.

## Climate Change

Climate change significantly impacts the CZ, particularly in altering the water cycle and affecting soil and vegetation.

One of the most significant impacts of climate change on the CZ (climate zone) is the alteration of precipitation patterns. As the climate warms, some regions are experiencing more intense rainfall events, while others face prolonged droughts. These changes can affect soil erosion rates, nutrient cycling, and water availability, all of which influence the health and productivity of ecosystems in the CZ.

Climate change can also reshape vegetation cover in the CZ. Variations in temperature and precipitation can shift the ranges of plant species, with some plants being better adapted to the new climate conditions than others. This shift can lead to changes in the composition and productivity of vegetation in the CZ, further affecting other ecological processes.

Moreover, climate change can disrupt biogeochemical cycles within the CZ. For instance, changes in temperature and precipitation can influence nutrient cycling and carbon storage rates, ultimately impacting the overall health and productivity of the ecosystem. These effects can significantly threaten the long-term sustainability of the CZ and the ecosystem services it provides to humans, including clean water and food production.

## The Anthropocene

The term "Anthropocene" gained significant traction in the scientific community and beyond. The term was coined by Nobel Prize-winning chemist Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer ([see The ‘Anthropocene’ (2000) | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-82202-6_2) and [Geology of mankind](https://doi.org/10.1038/415023a)). While the term itself was coined earlier, it was Crutzen and Stoermer's proposal that humanity had entered a new geological epoch due to its profound impact on the planet that resonated widely. The core idea behind the Anthropocene is that human activities have become the primary driver shaping the Earth's systems, to such an extent that they now rival the forces of natural geophysical processes. This influence has intensified significantly since the mid-20th century, a period often referred to as the "Great Acceleration," marked by an unprecedented surge in population growth, industrialization, and globalization. See

The Anthropocene is a proposed geological epoch that marks the impact of human activities on Earth’s geology and ecosystems. It is characterized by the significant changes in the Earth’s geology and ecosystems caused by human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and climate change.  The Anthropocene era is still a topic of debate among scientists and geologists.

The formalization of the Anthropocene as a geological epoch by the ICS has been a subject of considerable debate. The Anthropocene Working Group (AWG), tasked with evaluating the evidence, proposed a start date around 1950 CE, using the sharp upturn in plutonium levels resulting from nuclear weapons testing as a primary marker. However, in March 2024, the ICS Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) voted against this proposal, a decision later confirmed by the ICS and the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS). The rejection was largely attributed to concerns about the relatively shallow sedimentary record associated with such a recent start date and whether the proposed marker met the stringent criteria for defining a new epoch. An alternative perspective suggests defining the Anthropocene not as a formal epoch but as an ongoing "geological event," which might better reflect the complex and potentially diachronous nature of human impacts.

The critical zone, defined as the Earth's permeable near-surface layer "from the tops of the trees to the bottom of the groundwater," is profoundly affected by the Anthropocene. The Anthropocene era is defined within the context of the critical zone in the following ways:

- Dominant Human Influence: The defining characteristic of the Anthropocene in the critical zone is the overwhelming impact of human activities on its composition, structure, and functioning. Natural processes within the critical zone are now inextricably linked with and often overridden by anthropogenic forces.  

- Key Anthropogenic Drivers and Their Impacts:
    - Land-use Change: Activities like agriculture, deforestation, urbanization, and mining drastically alter the physical structure of the critical zone. This leads to soil erosion, habitat fragmentation, changes in water infiltration and storage, and altered biogeochemical cycles.   
    - Climate Change: Human-induced climate change affects temperature and precipitation patterns, leading to altered weathering rates, changes in vegetation cover, increased frequency of extreme events (like droughts and floods), and impacts on water availability within the critical zone.  
    - Pollution: The introduction of various pollutants (e.g., heavy metals, pesticides, plastics, industrial chemicals) into the atmosphere, water, and soil directly contaminates the critical zone, affecting its biological and chemical processes and threatening the health of ecosystems and human populations.
    - Altered Biogeochemical Cycles: Human activities, particularly the industrial fixation of nitrogen and the burning of fossil fuels, have significantly altered global nutrient cycles (nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon). This leads to eutrophication of water bodies, soil acidification, and changes in atmospheric composition, all of which cascade through the critical zone.  
    - Biodiversity Loss: Habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change driven by human actions are causing unprecedented rates of biodiversity loss within the critical zone, weakening ecosystem resilience and altering critical zone processes.
    - Geomorphic Changes: Human activities such as dam construction, river channelization, and large-scale excavation have become significant geomorphic agents, rivaling or exceeding natural rates of erosion and sedimentation within the critical zone.

The "Anthropogenic Critical Zone": Recognizing the profound and pervasive influence of humans, the concept of the "Anthropogenic Critical Zone" has emerged. This perspective emphasizes the need to study the critical zone not as a purely natural system but as one deeply intertwined with human activities and the "technosphere" (human-built infrastructure and technology).  

### Implications for Critical Zone Science:

Critical zone science in the Anthropocene requires a transdisciplinary approach, integrating knowledge from earth sciences, ecology, social sciences, and the humanities to understand the complex interactions between human actions and critical zone processes.   

Research focuses on quantifying the impacts of human activities on critical zone fluxes (water, carbon, nutrients, sediment) and understanding how these changes affect essential ecosystem services like food production, water quality, and carbon sequestration.

There is a growing emphasis on incorporating human agency and local knowledge into critical zone research and management to address environmental challenges effectively.  

In essence, the Anthropocene defines a state where the critical zone's development, function, and future trajectory are no longer governed primarily by natural forces but are increasingly shaped by human activities, demanding a new paradigm for understanding and managing this life-sustaining layer of our planet.

### The Anthrocene Epoch

The Anthropocene is NOT yet formally recognized as an official epoch within the Geologic Time Scale by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS). While the term is widely used informally in scientific and public discourse, the geological community is still debating its formal definition, start date, and whether it meets the criteria for a distinct epoch.  

- Proposed Start Date: The Anthropocene Working Group (AWG), which advocated for its formalization, proposed a start date around 1950 CE. This coincides with a period known as the "Great Acceleration," marked by significant increases in human population, industrial activity, resource consumption, and environmental impact, including the presence of nuclear fallout in geological strata.  

- Alternative Proposed Dates: While 1950 is a leading proposal, other start dates have been suggested, ranging from the beginning of agriculture to the Industrial Revolution.

- "Golden Spike": The AWG proposed Crawford Lake in Canada as the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), or "golden spike," to mark the beginning of the Anthropocene in the geological record, characterized by specific markers in the lake sediments dating to around 1950.  However, this proposal was ultimately rejected in a formal vote.  See [McCarthy et al, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1177/20530196221149281) for the evidence presented in support of the "golden spike."
