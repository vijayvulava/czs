# 6 Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry

Biogeochemistry plays a crucial role in the processes of the Critical Zone (CZ), a complex system composed of interacting regolith, water, air, nutrients, and organisms. This field of study examines how these components interact and transform over time. The biogeochemical processes within the CZ are essential for regulating nutrient cycling and energy flow, which are vital for sustaining terrestrial life, including that of humans. Insights gained from biogeochemistry can contribute to addressing significant challenges facing humanity, such as climate change and environmental stability.

This module explores the integrated roles of biology, geology, and chemistry in the CZ, with an emphasis on its biogeochemical functions. Through specific subunits focusing on phosphorus and eutrophication, as well as nutrient inputs and transformations, students will develop a deeper understanding of biogeochemistry's role in Critical Zone processes.

As you study biogeochemistry within the CZ, consider how you will: 
- Develop a scientific and geoscientific mindset through biogeochemical activities.
- Evaluate the chemical and biological processes that determine the composition of the CZ.
- Explain the significance of CZ services in supporting terrestrial life, including that of humans.
- Use examples to illustrate the impact of organisms and biodiversity on biogeochemical processes.
- Utilize data and examples from published scientific literature to explain the functions of the CZ.
- Describe common methods used in biogeochemical research.
- Analyze how variations in land use affect nutrient cycling and Critical Zone functions.

## Goals of the Module

**Overarching Learning Objective:** Describe and characterize how interactions among the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and soil (the CZ) support and influence life.  
- Unit 6.1: Review scientific articles discussing atmospheric inputs into tropical rainforests and nutrient movement through the biosphere and aquatic ecosystems. 
- Unit 6.2: Examine the role of phosphorus loading into water resources and the interactions of nutrients in agricultural systems using relevant data sets.
