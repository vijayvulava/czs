# 1 CZ Background

This module introduces us to the Critical Zone (CZ), a complex system that requires directed transdisciplinary study. CZ science is a relatively new field, having emerged less than two decades ago, and continues to evolve. Many fundamental approaches and concepts in CZ science are derived from decades of soil science and related research. These concepts are now being applied to develop systems models that enable scientists to predict the impacts of ongoing land use and climate change on the Critical Zone.

## Goals of this Module

The primary goal of this module is to recall, infer, and interpret a wide variety of scientific principles to analyze the Critical Zone (CZ) as a complex system of interacting components: regolith, water, air, energy, and life. By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Accurately define the CZ and explain its relationship with the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and soil.
* Effectively summarize: 
  1. The transdisciplinary nature of CZ science and its relationship to systems science.
  2. The CZ's significance (and degraded state) in supporting most terrestrial life, including humanity.
  3. The importance of long-term observatories in understanding and integrating knowledge of Earth's surface processes.

**Overarching Learning Objective:** Describe and characterize how the interactions among the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and soil (the CZ) support and influence life.

- Unit 1.1: The primary goal of this unit is to address the overarching learning objective and provide a generalized framework for considering the details of CZ structure, function, and processes throughout the course.  
- Unit 1.2: This unit focuses on the interactions among the various "spheres" of the CZ, specifically aimed at understanding a central component of the CZ: soil.
- Unit 1.3: This unit's qualitative system modeling activity helps reinforce students' understanding of the concepts learned in the first two units.
