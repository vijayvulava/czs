# 3 CZ Architecture and Evolution

CZ science encompasses a wide range of scientific fields and is inherently transdisciplinary. Some experienced and respected Earth surface and environmental scientists have expressed doubts about the legitimacy of CZ science, suggesting that its inquiries and observations resemble those found in soil and ecosystem science. However, a key distinction between these fields and CZ science is its emphasis on depth into the subsurface and across extensive geological timeframes. CZ scientists incorporate "deep thinking" into their research, meaning a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of geology and geosciences is essential to fully appreciate and comprehend CZ science.

The overlapping spheres are essential for facilitating various physical, chemical, and biological processes within the Critical Zone (CZ) and for shaping it. However, the lithosphere provides a solid foundation supporting these processes as they occur and evolve. Therefore, to understand the complex activities within the CZ, it is important to recognize its structure as informed by its geological context.

The geological characteristics of parent material type, topography, and overall geologic/tectonic setting interact to form an equally diverse set of landscapes and CZ architectures. However, similar landforms may recognize commonalities, which indicate similar formation processes that sculpt the CZ and control some of its ongoing processes.

## Goals of the Module

The primary goal of this module is for students to develop a foundational understanding of key geological processes and their relationship to critical zone (CZ) processes and science. The units focus on the role of the lithosphere in shaping CZ form and function. By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Accurately recognize how tectonic processes, such as uplift and subsidence, and the resulting landforms influence surface processes like erosion, sediment transport and deposition, hillside movement, and regolith production. They will also understand how these processes determine the architecture and evolution of the CZ.
- Effectively summarize freely available online resources that provide information on geological mapping and various forms of remotely sensed imagery that can be used for landscape assessment, applying these resources to a site evaluation.

**Overarching Learning Objective:** Describe and characterize how interactions among the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and soil (the CZ) support and influence life.
- Unit 3.1: Geology and Geomorphology - Review the fundamental geological processes that contribute to large-scale geomorphic features of the landscape.
- Unit 3.2: Landforms and Remote Sensing - Review characteristic geomorphic landscapes and the processes that shape them.
