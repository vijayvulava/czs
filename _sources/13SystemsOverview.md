# 1.3 Systems Approach

The term ***Earth system science*** refers to the scientific study, primarily through quantitative modeling, of the interactions among the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere. Including the lithosphere in this framework encompasses all the main components, or "spheres," of the Critical Zone (CZ).

This lesson will explore basic systems science concepts, mainly how they apply to CZ science. Students will engage in developing a qualitative systems model graphic of the CZ. The knowledge gained in this lesson will be used later in the semester for a deeper understanding of systems thinking related to the CZ.

As you learn about the systems approach, consider the following learning goals:

- Define the term "system" about the natural world and distinguish between quantitative and qualitative system modeling.
- Design a qualitative model of the Critical Zone system.
- Explain how and when humans have altered global erosion rates.
- Recognize the consequences of human influence on ecosystems.
- Discuss how human-induced climate change is expected to affect the hydrologic cycle.
- Describe the global-scale, human-induced changes observed in soils, the role of agriculture in these changes, and the consequences of these soil changes.
- Formulate and evaluate adaptive actions that humanity can take to reduce negative impacts on the Critical Zone and soils. 


## Earth Systems

The term *system* is frequently used to describe Earth as an integrated whole. The concept of a system enables scientists to divide a significant, complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts for easier study. 

A system is defined as any segment of the universe that can be isolated from the rest for the purpose of observing and measuring changes. The term *system* is frequently used to describe Earth as an integrated whole. The concept of a system enables scientists to divide a large, complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts for easier study. 

A system is defined as any portion of the universe and can be whatever the observer chooses it to be. This means that the concept of a system is flexible; you determine its boundaries based on the convenience of your study. It can be large or small, simple or complex. For instance, a system might encompass the entire universe from an astronomer's perspective, an aquifer for a hydrogeologist, or a petri dish for a microbiologist. The choice of system depends on the specific problem being studied. For example, various processes are taking place in a coastal environment, making it crucial to define the boundaries of the system being analyzed clearly.

See {numref}`earth-systems` for an example of how various processes on Earth can be studied using a systems approach.

A system is considered isolated from the rest of the universe if it has a boundary that distinguishes it from its surroundings. The characteristics of this boundary are crucial in defining the system. We can categorize systems into three basic types—isolated, closed, and open—each with different boundaries.

## Systems Feedback

As a system operates, it generates outputs that influence its functioning. These outputs act as “information” that returns to various points within the system. Feedback information can guide and sometimes control further system operations, often forming pathways known as feedback loops.

When feedback information discourages change in the system, it is referred to as ***negative feedback***. In other words, negative feedback occurs when taking a specific action, which leads to fewer instances of that action. For example, suppose you email your instructor with questions about this course and receive clear answers. In that case, you will likely have fewer questions, resulting in less need to send clarification emails. Negative feedback promotes stability within the classroom system and reduces the need for extra assistance.

Conversely, when feedback information encourages change in the system, it is called ***positive feedback***. For instance, if you email your course instructor with questions and receive confusing responses that lead to more inquiries, you will likely continue to send additional emails as your questions multiply. In this case, positive feedback creates instability within the classroom system; if it remains unchecked, this feedback loop could ultimately lead to you dropping the class.

It's important to note that negative feedback is not inherently “bad,” nor is positive feedback necessarily “good.” Each type of feedback relates to system stability: negative feedback opposes changes in the system and leads to stability, while positive feedback encourages instability, and if left unchecked, it can result in a runaway effect. In natural systems, such unrestrained changes can reach critical limits, leading to system disruption or even the death of organisms.

In the context of Earth system science, systems consist of components that are interconnected and typically interact in complex ways. These systems can also interact with other systems. The interactions or relationships between these components are referred to as couplings.

**Positive couplings** occur when a change in one component—regardless of whether an increase or decrease—results in a change in the same direction in a linked component. In contrast, **negative couplings** mean that a change in one component leads to a change in the opposite direction in the linked component.

**Feedback loops** are pathways of change and response. Negative feedback loops tend to reduce or mitigate the effects of change, while positive feedback loops usually amplify changes.

The state of a system is described by its characteristics at a specific moment in time. Changes in the state of a system are driven by:
1. Interactions with other systems
2. Interactions among components within the same system


## System Equilibrium

Most systems maintain their structure and characteristics over time. An energy and material system that remains balanced over time, where the conditions are consistent, is said to be in a ***steady-state*** condition. When the rates of inputs and outputs in the system are equal, and the amounts of energy and matter stored within the system fluctuate around a stable average, the system is in steady-state equilibrium. For example, river channels often adjust their shape in response to varying water and sediment inputs. Although the amounts of these inputs may change yearly, the river channel’s form represents a stable average—a steady-state condition.

Systems in equilibrium tend to maintain their functional operations and resist sudden changes. However, a system may reach a threshold, or tipping point, beyond which it can no longer retain its characteristics, leading to a drastic shift in its operations. For instance, a significant flood in a river system can push the river channel to this threshold, causing it to carve a new path abruptly. Similarly, a landslide can alter a hillside or coastal bluff, driving it toward a new equilibrium that balances slope, materials, and energy over time.

Plant and animal communities can also reach these thresholds. A notable case is the decline of frog populations in response to a deadly fungus that has spread globally; over 200 known species—approximately 3% of the total—have gone extinct since 1970. Scientists estimate that by 2100, 10% of all frog species may be lost.

An equilibrium state remains unchanged unless the system is disturbed. Temporary disturbances to a system are called perturbations, while persistent disturbances are known as forcing. If slight disturbances cause a system to move further from equilibrium, it is considered unstable.

## System Models

A model is a simplified and idealized representation of part of the real world that helps us understand complex processes. Scientists design models with varying degrees of detail. A conceptual model is typically the most generalized and focuses on how processes interact within a system. In contrast, a numerical model is more specific and usually based on field or laboratory work data. The simplicity of a model makes a system easier to understand and simulate in experiments. An example is a model of the hydrologic system, which represents Earth’s entire water system, its related energy flows, and the atmosphere, surface, and subsurface environments through which water moves.

The storage and movement of material and energy in a group of interacting systems is often represented as a ***box model***. A box model can illustrate the following essential features of a system: 
1. The processes by which matter (or energy) enters and leaves the system and the rates at which these exchanges occur.
2. The processes by which matter (or energy) moves among the various parts of the system internally, and the rates at which this movement happens.
3. The amount of matter (or energy) in the system at a given time and distribution.

As illustrated in {numref}`hydro-box-model`, the "boxes" in a box model represent the locations where water (or energy, or any material of interest) is stored for a period within the system. These storage locations are referred to as ***reservoirs***. When the flow of matter into a reservoir matches the flow out of that reservoir, we say that the reservoir is at ***steady state***. The average time water spends in these reservoirs is known as its ***residence time***. The residence time of material in a particular reservoir is influenced by many factors, including the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the material itself, the characteristics of the reservoir, and any external forces or processes acting on either the material or the reservoir.

Under steady-state conditions, the residence time can be calculated as shown in eq {eq}`residence-time`.

\text{Residence time} = \dfrac{\text{Reservoir Amount}}{\text{Rate of addition/removal}}
