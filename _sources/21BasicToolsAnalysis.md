# 2.1 Basic Tools and Analysis

This module introduces the methods that will be used throughout the remainder of the course. Critical Zone (CZ) science studies the Earth's surface, where all humans reside. The methods introduced in this module will establish a foundation for investigating the natural environment and human-induced changes, including disturbances to the hydrologic cycle, carbon and nutrient cycles, and soil degradation. Additionally, this unit will lay the groundwork for examining the environment from an interdisciplinary perspective. Specifically, this module will:

* Demonstrate how the grand challenges related to geosciences are addressed using CZ methods.
* Teach data visualization and analysis skills using authentic data.
* Introduce biogeochemistry and isotope geochemistry methods to explore natural and anthropogenic influences on the CZ.
* Familiarize students with geospatial techniques essential for studying the Earth's CZ.
* Investigate systems modeling as a means to illuminate CZ processes.
* Guide the use of library resources and the construction of an annotated bibliography based on a self-identified research question related to the interdisciplinary nature of CZ science.


## Annotated Bibliography

### What is Annotated Bibliography

An annotated bibliography includes descriptions and explanations of your listed sources that go beyond the basic citation information you typically provide.

One reason for citing sources and compiling a general bibliography is to demonstrate that you have conducted valid research to support your arguments and claims. Readers can refer to citations in your bibliography and look up the materials themselves. When inspired by your text or arguments, interested researchers may want to verify a claim or interpretation you've made or continue researching based on their interests. However, while a bibliography offers a list of research sources with publishing details, it often lacks comprehensive information about the sources themselves.

An annotated bibliography provides specific information about each source you have used. As a researcher, you become an expert on your topic, enabling you to explain the content of your sources, assess their usefulness, and share this information with others who might be less familiar with them. Consider your paper part of a conversation with people who share your interests; the annotated bibliography allows you to recommend resources, suggest what might be worth checking out, and indicate what may not be worth the reader's time. It's akin to providing a list of good movies for your classmates and discussing them, explaining why one movie is better or why a particular student might enjoy one film more. Your goal is to give your audience enough information to understand the main content of the sources and make informed decisions about where to direct their attention based on their interests.

An annotated bibliography consists of citations for books, articles, and documents. Each citation is followed by a brief (usually about 150 words) descriptive and evaluative paragraph known as the annotation. The annotation informs the reader about the cited sources' relevance, accuracy, and quality.

*It is important to note that annotations are not abstracts.* Abstracts are purely descriptive summaries commonly found at the beginning of scholarly journal articles or in periodical indexes. Annotations are descriptive and critical; they may discuss the author's perspective, authority, and the clarity and appropriateness of expression.


### What does an annotated bibliography do?

**A Good Annotated Bibliography:**

- Encourages critical thinking about the content of the works you are using, their place within a field of study, and their relation to your research and ideas.
- Demonstrates that you have read and understand your sources.
- Establishes your work as a valid source and you as a competent researcher.
- Situate your study and topic within an ongoing professional conversation.
- Provides a way for others to determine whether a source will be helpful to their research.
- Helps interested researchers gauge their interest in a topic by providing background information and an overview of the current work in the field.

### What Elements Might an Annotation Include?

1. A bibliography in the appropriate citation style (MLA, APA, CBE/CSE, etc.).
2. An explanation of the work's main points and/or purpose—essentially, its thesis—demonstrating that you have read and thoroughly understood the source.
3. Verification or critique of the authority or qualifications of the author.
4. Comments on the work's worth, effectiveness, and usefulness of your research topic and project.
5. The point of view or perspective from which the work was written. For example, you might note whether the author has specific biases or is targeting a particular audience.
6. Relevant links to other work in the area, such as related sources, including comparisons with other works on your list. You may want to identify connections to different aspects of the same argument or opposing views.

The first four elements listed above are typically essential parts of an annotated bibliography. Points 5 and 6 may involve a deeper analysis of the source, but they can also be included in other annotations besides evaluative ones. Depending on the type of annotation you use, which this guide will address in the next section, you may need to include additional information.

Resource materials are often grouped into sub-headed sections based on content for more extensive research papers (typically ten pages or longer). However, this may not be necessary for the assignments you will be working on. For longer papers, consult your instructor about her preferences regarding annotated bibliographies.

### Types of Annotations

As you now know, one annotation type does not fit all purposes! There are different kinds of annotations, depending on what you want your reader to learn about a source. Your assignments usually specify the citation format you must use, but they may not always clarify which annotation type to employ. In that case, consider asking your instructor for guidance or looking for keywords in the assignment to help you decide. For example, suppose the assignment states that your annotated bibliography should provide evidence demonstrating an analytical understanding of the sources you've used. In that case, "analytical" indicates that you must evaluate the sources and include some critique.

### The Process

Creating an annotated bibliography calls for applying various intellectual skills: concise exposition, succinct analysis, and informed library research.

First, locate and record citations for books, periodicals, and documents that may contain helpful information and ideas related to your topic. Briefly examine and review the selected items, then choose works that provide a range of perspectives. 

Cite each book, article, or document using the appropriate citation style. 

Write a concise annotation summarizing the work's central theme and scope. Include one or more of the following elements: (a) an evaluation of the author’s authority or background, (b) a comment on the intended audience, (c) a comparison with another work you have cited, or (d) an explanation of how this work enhances your bibliography topic.

#### Conduct Your Searches to Find Evidence:

- Use keywords from your question as well as synonyms in your search terms. 
- Save your searches in databases to save time when you want to redo or modify them. This will also serve as a helpful guide if your searches are not yielding valuable results. 
- Carefully review the abstracts of research studies to save time.
- Utilize the bibliographies and references of research studies you find to discover additional sources. 
- Consult your professor or a subject expert if you are missing key field works. 
- Don't hesitate to ask your librarian for assistance at any stage.
- Use a citation manager, such as Mendeley, as a repository for your citations. Visit [Mendeley - Reference Management Software](https://www.mendeley.com/?interaction_required=true) to sign up for a free account and download the desktop software to link it to your Word application.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

Data is fundamental to all scientific endeavors. It can take various forms, including measurements collected in the field or laboratory, geographic coordinates, census data, maps, and more. Effective visualization of this data enhances our understanding of the underlying science across different disciplines.
