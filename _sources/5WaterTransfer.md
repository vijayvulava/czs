# 5 Water Transfer Through the CZ

Water plays a vital role in the CZ. Water helps shape the structure and function of the CZ by moving through its pores and cracks, dissolving minerals, transporting nutrients and supporting living organisms. Water also influences the climate and weather patterns that affect the CZ.

In this module we will cover CZ water transfers at multiple scales. First, we will calculate a mass balance for an individual tree before scaling up to the catchment level. Multiple approaches will be used, including an equation-based problem set, and a graphical simulation exercise. This Water Transfers module encourages systems thinking, with the ultimate focus on two points: first, that in a mass balance, inputs must equal outputs plus the change in storage, and second that a tree can be an important part of the water balance. This module then teaches the students how to scale up from point measurements to catchment measurements and perform water balances on a catchment scale.

As you are studying water transfer within the CZ, consider how you will 
- Explain the reservoirs and fluxes of water cycling among the different parts of the CZ.
- Analyze the water budget of a catchment that includes both biotic and abiotic processes.
- Calculate water budget components at multiple scales.
- Assess anthropogenic changes to the water cycling in a catchment.


## Goals of the Module

**Overarching Learning Objective:** Describe and characterize how interaction among the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and soil (The CZ) support and influence life.
- Unit 5.1: Vegetation acts as an intermediary in water transfers between the lithosphere and the atmosphere and regulates discharge of water from subsurface to surface water bodies. Students describe components of the water balance and quantify the role of vegetation in the water balance on a tree scale.
- Unit 5.2: Water flows in the CZ link atmosphere, lithosphere, biosphere, and soil. Students will describe methods of studying water transfers in the CZ at different scales. Students will learn to interpolate point data to areal averages. Students will make and justify water management decisions where water supply (amount, location and timing) limits uses.
