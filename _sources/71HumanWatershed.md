# 7.1 Watershed Impacts

Humans play a crucial role in driving change in the CZ. In this module, we will focus on the connection between land and water and explore how human-induced land use changes affect local hydrology. You will apply knowledge from previous modules about how hydrologists use data—such as land cover type, soil texture, and slope—to predict the movement of water through built environments. 

Using the Model My Watershed application, you will evaluate the impact of human alterations to the landscape and investigate how best management practices can mitigate these effects. Additionally, you will consider the societal impacts arising from increased runoff and the various mitigation measures implemented.

In this section, you will:

- Describe what a watershed is and delineate a watershed on a map.
- Identify the key factors within a watershed that influence runoff and sediment yield. Explain how increased stormwater runoff affects landscapes, leading to issues such as erosion, channel incision, and sedimentation. Additionally, discuss how these factors are impacted by human development.
- Evaluate the effects of human alterations to the landscape and explore how best management practices can mitigate these impacts.
- Compare the social and economic implications for society arising from changes in runoff and the measures taken to address these changes.
- Analyze how neighborhood redevelopment can affect local communities, considering both potential benefits and drawbacks.


## Watersheds

A watershed is an area of land where all the water that falls or flows within it drains into a single body of water, such as a river, lake, or ocean. The boundaries of a watershed are determined by the landscape's topography, with higher elevations forming ridges or divides that separate one watershed from another.

A watershed is the land area that drains to a common body of water, such as a stream, lake, bay, or even the ocean.

Watersheds can vary in size, ranging from small first-order streams to large river basins that cover extensive areas of land, even at a continental scale. They play a crucial role in the hydrological cycle by capturing and storing precipitation and gradually releasing it over time. This process provides water for human consumption, irrigation, and industrial uses and supports aquatic ecosystems. Understanding the boundaries, characteristics, and functions of watersheds is essential for effective land and water management, as well as for conservation and restoration efforts.

## What's in our Watersheds

We have previously used  [StreamStats | U.S. Geological Survey (usgs.gov)](https://www.usgs.gov/streamstats) to delineate watersheds at a small scale.  Here, we will explore another application called [Model My Watershed](https://modelmywatershed.org/) to learn more about what's in our watersheds. Follow the instructions below to try this application.

```{admonition} Model My Watershed

Let's use [Model My Watershed® - WikiWatershed](https://wikiwatershed.org/model/) which is an interactive web-based hydrologic modeling tool that allows users to calculate water budgets for various storm intensities, generic land-cover types, and soil textures for a generic patch of land ("Micro model") or for an area you have defined in your watershed ("Watershed model"). 

1. Launch [Model My Watershed® - WikiWatershed](https://wikiwatershed.org/model/) 
2. Zoom into some area of interest;
- For rural watershed-scale areas, turn on HUC-12 Watershed boundaries using "Select by Boundaries".
- For smaller urban areas, use "Draw Area" to define your area of interest.

3. Analyze Tab contains:
- Land Tab - Bar chart of % Landcover
- Soil Tab - Bar chart of % Soil infiltration capacity
- Animals Tab - Farm census for your area
- Point Sources (if any) from EPA NPDES (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System)
- Water Quality - Delaware River Basin only

4. Model tab (Site Storm Model (with precipitation controlled by slider) or Watershed Multi-year (annual) Model
- Runoff/Hydrology tab - Water budget components: graphs (above), table (below)
- Water Quality tab - Water Quality component tables: Landcover source zone (above), TMDL (below)

5. Do these make sense based on your knowledge of the area?
6. How does the amount of precipitation affect the water balance? (site storm model)
7. Which seasons contribute the most sediment to the stream? Why? (multi-year model)

## Stormwater Runoff and Pollution

Stormwater runoff pollution occurs when rainwater or melted snow flows over the ground and into storm drains, rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water, carrying various pollutants with it. As the water travels over the land, it can pick up contaminants such as oil, grease, pesticides, fertilizers, animal waste, litter, and sediment. These pollutants can significantly harm water quality and lead to various environmental issues.

A major source of stormwater runoff pollution is urbanization, which increases the number of impervious surfaces like roads, parking lots, and buildings. These surfaces prevent water from soaking into the ground, causing it to flow rapidly over the surface and collect pollutants along the way.

To learn about the water quality issues in your community waterways, see [How's My Waterway - Community (epa.gov)](https://mywaterway.epa.gov/community).


### Stormwater BMPs

The primary method for controlling stormwater runoff is through the use of best management practices (BMPs). Stormwater BMPs consist of various devices, practices, or methods designed to manage runoff by controlling peak runoff rates, improving water quality, and managing runoff volumes.

Examples of BMPs include reducing the amount of impervious surfaces, using permeable paving materials, and implementing green infrastructure solutions such as rain gardens and bioswales. Additionally, individuals can help reduce stormwater runoff pollution by properly disposing of trash, chemicals, and other pollutants and by minimizing the use of fertilizers and pesticides on their lawns and gardens.

Investigate various best management practices (BMPs) for water management in urban and suburban neighborhoods. Research different BMPs and explore their appropriate applications. Choose specific locations in an area of your interest and develop designs that incorporate BMPs to address problematic areas where runoff causes issues. Individual students or teams will present their designs to the class, both orally and through a handout for discussion purposes.
