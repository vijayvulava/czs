# 2 Methods in CZ Science

This module presents basic scientific methods, such as literature searches and graphing (Unit 2.1) as well as CZ specific methods, such as biogeochemistry, isotope geochemistry, geospatial investigation, and systems modeling (Unit 2.2), that will be used in later modules. The exercises presented in the two units are designed to introduce students to skills that they will build on in this course and in other geosciences courses.

This module is an introduction to methods that will be used in the remainder of the course. CZ science is the study of Earth's surface, where all humans live. The methods introduced here provide a base for investigations of the natural environment as well as human-induced changes to the environment such as perturbations to the hydrologic cycle, carbon and nutrient cycles and soil degradation. The unit will also provide a basis to investigate the environment from an interdisciplinary perspective. Specifically, this module will:
* Illustrate how geosciences related grand challenges are addressed by CZ methods.
* Learn data visualization and analysis skills using authentic data.
* Learn how to use biogeochemistry and isotope geochemistry methods to investigate natural and anthropogenic influences on the CZ.
* Familiarize students with geospatial techniques necessary to investigate Earth's CZ.
* Investigate systems modeling as a method to illuminate CZ processes.
* Use library reference resources and the construction of an annotated bibliography around a self-identified research question related to the interdisciplinary nature of CZ science.

## Goals of the Module

**Specific Module Goals**
- Introduce students to effective literature review methods and hypothesis development.
- Improve students' capacity to interpret and present data using standard graphical methods.
- Engage students in specific methods to understand the nature of CZ science.

**Overarching Learning Objective:**Â Describe and characterize how interaction among the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and soil (The CZ) support and influence life.
- Unit 2.1: Provides skills on how to conduct library research on critical-zone topics.
- Unit 2.2: Introduces CZ specific methods used to investigate Earth's CZ.
