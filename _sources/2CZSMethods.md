# 2 Methods in CZ Science

This module introduces fundamental scientific methods, such as literature searches and data visualization techniques (Unit 2.1), alongside specific methods related to the Critical Zone (CZ), including biogeochemistry, isotope geochemistry, geospatial investigation, and systems modeling (Unit 2.2). These methods will be essential in later modules. The exercises in these units are designed to equip students with skills that they will further develop in this and other geoscience courses.

The focus of this module is on the methods that will be utilized throughout the remainder of the course. Critical Zone science examines Earth's surface, where all human life exists. The techniques introduced here provide a foundation for investigating the natural environment and the human-induced changes that affect it, such as disruptions to the hydrologic cycle, carbon and nutrient cycles, and soil degradation. This module will also establish a basis for exploring environmental issues from an interdisciplinary perspective. Specifically, it will:

- Illustrate how Critical Zone methods address significant challenges in geosciences.
- Teach data visualization and analysis skills using real-world data.
- Demonstrate the application of biogeochemistry and isotope geochemistry methods to examine both natural and human-induced influences on the Critical Zone.
- Familiarize students with the geospatial techniques required to study Earth's Critical Zone.
- Explore systems modeling as a method to understand Critical Zone processes.
- Guide students in using library resources to construct an annotated bibliography centered on a self-identified research question related to the interdisciplinary nature of Critical Zone science.

## Goals of the Module

**Specific Module Goals:**
- Introduce students to effective literature review methods and hypothesis development.
- Enhance students' ability to interpret and present data using standard graphical methods.
- Engage students in specific techniques to understand the nature of Critical Zone science.

**Overarching Learning Objective:** Describe and characterize how the interactions among the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and soil (the Critical Zone) support and influence life.
- Unit 2.1: Provides skills for conducting library research on Critical Zone topics.
- Unit 2.2: Introduces CZ-specific methods used to investigate Earth's Critical Zone.
