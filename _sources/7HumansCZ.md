# 7 Humans in the CZ

All humans live in the Critical Zone (CZ) and depend on it for resources necessary for their livelihoods. However, while conducting daily activities, humans affect the natural CZ processes upon which they depend. They also have impacts on the natural environment that, in many cases, need to be addressed by changes in both attitudes and actions. In this module we will continue to examine how geoscientists study processes in the CZ and the interactions between natural processes and human activities that affect it. We will also examine strategies and methods developed by geoscientists and engineers for ameliorating disruptions to natural systems, while considering social and economic impacts on individuals and communities. 

Humans impact the CZ in many ways. The CZ is under ever-increasing pressure from human perturbations such as land use intensification, global environmental changes, and expanding consumption patterns. Human activities such as deforestation, mining, agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization can alter the CZ processes and functions. For example, deforestation can lead to soil erosion and loss of soil organic matter (SOM), which can reduce soil fertility and productivity. Mining activities can cause soil compaction and contamination with heavy metals. Agriculture can lead to soil degradation due to overuse of fertilizers and pesticides. Urbanization can cause soil sealing and loss of vegetation cover. Industrialization can lead to air pollution that can affect soil health.

Human impacts on the CZ are complex and multifaceted. However, it is important to understand how human activities affect the CZ processes and functions so that we can develop strategies for sustainable management of this critical zone.

We will develop and implement strategies to address anthropogenic environmental impacts while also considering impacts to communities. Specifically, we will look at issues such as climate change, land-use change, access to potable water and universal access to food. In so doing, the unit will specifically address the human impacts on water availability and food supplies.

As you are studying human impact on the CZ, consider how you will identify, describe and analyze:
- the complex responses that natural and man-made ecosystems have to human perturbations (e.g., deforestation, agriculture, development)
- mechanisms that reduce human perturbations on the CZ
- political, economic and cultural impacts of perturbations in the CZ
- ways to reduce human perturbations on the CZ while maintaining or improving economic, political and social conditions using the Model My Watershed application


## Goals of the Module

**Overarching Learning Objective:**Â Describe and characterize how interaction among the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and soil (The CZ) support and influence life.
- Unit 7.1: Using GIS and the Generic Model from the Model My Watershed application, you will learn how human activity affects the CZ, and methods that can ameliorate those impacts.
- Unit 7.2: You will learn how agricultural practices affected soils in the CZ and what measures can be implemented to reduce these human impacts.
