# 7 Humans in the CZ

All humans live within the Critical Zone (CZ) and rely on it for essential resources that support their livelihoods. However, while engaging in daily activities, humans impact the natural processes of the CZ upon which they depend. These impacts often necessitate changes in both attitudes and actions to address the resulting effects on the environment. In this module, we will further explore how geoscientists study the processes in the CZ and the interactions between natural processes and human activities that influence them. We will also look into the strategies and methods developed by geoscientists and engineers to mitigate disruptions to these natural systems while considering the social and economic impacts on individuals and communities.

Humans affect the CZ in numerous ways, and it faces increasing pressure from human activities such as land use intensification, global environmental changes, and expanding consumption patterns. Activities like deforestation, mining, agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization can disrupt CZ processes and functions. For example, deforestation can lead to soil erosion and loss of soil organic matter, reducing soil fertility and productivity. Mining can cause soil compaction and contamination with heavy metals. Agriculture may result in soil degradation due to excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides. Urbanization can lead to soil sealing and loss of vegetation cover, while industrialization may contribute to air pollution that adversely affects soil health.

The impacts of human actions on the CZ are complex and multifaceted. It is crucial to understand these impacts to develop strategies for the sustainable management of this critical zone.

We will design and implement strategies to address human-related environmental impacts while considering their effects on communities. Specifically, we will examine issues such as climate change, land-use change, access to clean water, and universal food security. This unit will concentrate on the human impacts on water availability and food supplies.

As you study the human impact on the CZ, consider how you will identify, describe, and analyze:
- The complex responses of natural and man-made ecosystems to human perturbations (e.g., deforestation, agriculture, development)
- Mechanisms that can reduce human perturbations on the CZ
- The political, economic, and cultural repercussions of perturbations in the CZ
- Strategies to minimize human disturbances in the CZ while maintaining or improving economic, political, and social conditions using the Model My Watershed application

## Goals of the Module

**Overarching Learning Objective:** Describe and characterize how the interactions among the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and soil (the CZ) support and influence life.
- Unit 7.1: Using GIS and the Generic Model from the Model My Watershed application, you will learn how human activities affect the CZ and explore methods to mitigate these impacts.
- Unit 7.2: You will study how agricultural practices affect soils in the CZ and explore measures that can be implemented to reduce these human impacts.
