# 3.1 Geology and Geomorphology

Parent material is crucial to the pedogenic system and the critical zone (CZ). All other factors that contribute to soil formation act upon the parent material to develop soil, highlighting the distinctive role of the original, unweathered composition of the parent material in the resulting weathered product.

The geology of a region dictates the types of parent material available for pedogenesis. Parent material can consist of various rock types with differing geochemical compositions, which may be lithified (hardened) or unconsolidated. This material can also range from relatively recent to billions of years old. The geological context of a region, both in the past and present, determines the existence of mountains or valleys, significantly influencing the topographic setting in which CZ processes operate and soils are formed. Additionally, the geological setting indicates whether the parent material is in an active environment, recently exposed to pedogenic processes, or in a more stable area where soil formation has occurred continuously for hundreds of millennia, influenced only by climatic and biological changes.

Let's review some basic principles of geology and geomorphology.

## Fundamental Geological Principles

Geology is the scientific discipline focused on understanding Earth's physical features and processes, as well as the history of the planet and its inhabitants since its formation. A fundamental understanding of geology can enhance your appreciation of geoheritage sites and scenic landscapes.

```

[James Hutton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hutton)’s observations related to uniformitarianism also serve as the foundation for another essential geological principle known as cross-cutting relationships. This technique is used in relative age dating. In brief, an intrusive rock body is younger than the rocks it disrupts. 

For example, [Salisbury Crag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holyrood_Park#Salisbury_Crags), a well-known landmark in Edinburgh that Hutton studied, owes its distinct shape to a thick layer of resistant basalt. Through his observations of the heated contacts above and below the basalt and where the basalt intruded into the underlying and overlying sedimentary layers, Hutton demonstrated that this thick basalt body was not simply a flow that had formed in succession. Instead, it was intruded as hot magma into the surrounding sedimentary rocks long after those rocks had been deposited ([Eicher 1976](https://archive.org/details/geologictime0000eich_z7h8)).

Similar relationships include faults younger than the rock layers they cut through and erosional surfaces younger than the eroded rocks.

[William Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Smith_(geologist)) (1769–1839), an engineer and surveyor, traveled extensively throughout England's countryside. He identified and mapped numerous sedimentary rock units while investigating roads, quarries, mines, and canals. Smith observed that each successive rock layer contained a unique set of fossils. His key finding—that strata can be identified by their fossil content—became the law of faunal succession. This discovery allowed geologists to use fossils to differentiate rock units of various ages. Consequently, faunal succession emerged as a fundamental principle for categorizing and recognizing rock units across different regions.

Although Smith's findings raised questions about ancient life that were not easy to answer then, they made it possible to correlate distant localities. A framework was established to assign a stratigraphic classification based on the temporal relationships of strata rather than relying solely on rock types, which had previously been thought to indicate age. In summary, this was the crucial discovery that stratigraphic geology needed to advance further ([Eicher 1976](https://archive.org/details/geologictime0000eich_z7h8)).


### Organic Evolution

```


Organic evolution is the **theory** that modern plants and animals originate from pre-existing forms, with notable differences between ancestors and descendants arising from modifications over successive generations. [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin) (1809–1882) did not invent the concept of organic evolution; thinkers before him, such as the French naturalist [Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck) (1744–1829), a pioneer in invertebrate paleontology, and [Erasmus Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_Darwin) (1744–1802), Charles's grandfather, explored similar ideas. However, until Charles Darwin’s time, the theory had not gained widespread acceptance, primarily due to earlier scientists lacking crucial data and the Huttonian concept of geologic time, which are essential for the evolutionary argument. Darwin’s significant contribution was proposing a mechanism—natural selection—to explain how evolutionary change occurs.

A key requirement for evolution is that sufficient time is needed to produce these changes, which is where the concept of [uniformitarianism](https://www.nps.gov/articles/geologic-principles-uniformitarianism.htm) comes into play. This idea serves as the first link in Darwin’s chain of reasoning. The relationship between organic evolution and geologic time is that the randomness of minor, fortuitous evolutionary variations in species—resulting in noticeable changes in an organism's physical form—requires immense time. Building on uniformitarianism, Darwin formulated a compelling and rational argument for the origin of our world's diverse organisms.

### Organic Extinction

```

For over 300 years, naturalists have recognized that fossils are the remains of once-living plants and animals. They proposed that particular species formerly existing were no longer alive; in other words, they had become extinct. However, the concept of extinction took some time to gain acceptance among the majority. The main reason for this hesitance was that the most well-known fossils were marine invertebrates. While these fossils are just as valid as terrestrial organisms in demonstrating extinction, little was understood about ocean life at the beginning of the 19th century. Aware of the significant gaps in their knowledge, naturalists of that era were reluctant to assert that certain marine animals represented by fossils no longer existed anywhere on Earth; they considered the possibility that these organisms might still be living in some deeper, unexplored part of the ocean ([Eicher 1976](https://archive.org/details/geologictime0000eich_z7h8)).

Following William Smith's work on faunal succession, [Georges Cuvier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Cuvier) (1769–1832), a French naturalist and zoologist, developed the stratigraphic sequences of terrestrial vertebrates and marine invertebrates in the strata of the Paris Basin. In 1812, Cuvier conclusively demonstrated that many fossil vertebrates had no known living counterparts, and people acknowledged that it was improbable for such large land animals to go undiscovered ([Eicher 1976](https://archive.org/details/geologictime0000eich_z7h8)).

Like William Smith, Cuvier recognized distinctive fossils, but he placed greater emphasis on the changes in these fossils over time. As Cuvier meticulously mapped the succession of different faunas in the strata of the Paris Basin, he observed that the younger deposits contained creatures more similar to modern-day species than the older deposits ([Eicher 1976](https://archive.org/details/geologictime0000eich_z7h8)). Thus, Cuvier not only proved the extinction of species but also showed that each changing sequence of faunas corresponds to a specific period in the geological past.

### Superposition and Original Horizontality

In 1669, [Nicolaus Steno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Steno) first clearly stated that rock layers, or strata, exhibit sequential changes, indicating that rocks have histories. Through his studies in the mountains of western Italy, Steno discovered that the principle of superposition in stratified rocks is crucial for linking time to these rocks. Essentially, each layer of sedimentary rock, also known as a "bed," is older than the layer above it and younger than the layer below it. This seemingly simple superposition rule has become the most fundamental principle of relative dating. Although Steno initially based his conclusions on observations of sedimentary rocks, the principle also applies to other materials deposited on the surface, such as lava flows and volcanic ash beds.

Additionally, Steno recognized the importance of another principle: original horizontality. This principle states that strata are initially deposited in nearly horizontal positions. Therefore, if a rock layer is folded or inclined at a steep angle, it indicates that the layer has been moved into that position by crustal disturbances (such as mountain building, faults, or plate tectonics) sometime after it was deposited.

### Uniformitarianism

**Uniformitarianism** is a fundamental concept in geology. It asserts that the same **natural laws and processes** that operate today have always been at work throughout Earth’s history. In other words, the present is the key to understanding the past. Let’s delve into this principle:
**Uniformitarianism** posits that Earth's geological processes—both gradual and sudden—have consistently shaped the planet over time. Events such as **earthquakes**, the **erosion** of river valleys, and **volcanic eruptions** occur today as they did in the past.

Before 1830, scientists adhered to the theory of **catastrophism**, which argued that significant, abrupt changes (or catastrophes) were responsible for shaping Earth's features, such as mountains. However, two influential figures challenged this perspective:

1. [James Hutton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hutton) (1726–1797), a Scottish farmer and naturalist, observed that natural processes—like mountain-building and erosion—occurred gradually over time. He formulated the **Principle of Uniformitarianism**, emphasizing the slow, continuous forces that shape the Earth’s surface.

2. [Charles Lyell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lyell) (1797–1875), a Scottish geologist, further championed uniformitarianism. His book, _Principles of Geology_, debunked catastrophism. Lyell found evidence that sea levels had risen and fallen, volcanoes could form atop older rocks, and valleys eroded slowly due to the power of water.

The combined efforts of Hutton and Lyell laid the foundation for modern geology. Interestingly, **Charles Darwin**, the father of evolutionary biology, viewed uniformitarianism as support for his theory of species emergence. He recognized that the evolution of life required vast periods, which geology confirmed.

### The Present is the Key to the Past

Many geologists consider James Hutton to be the father of historical geology. Hutton observed various processes such as wave action, erosion caused by running water, and sediment transport. He concluded that, given enough time, these processes could explain the geological features of his native Scotland. He believed that “the past history of our globe must be explained by what can be seen to be happening now.” This idea that present-day processes have been at work throughout geological time formed the basis of the principle of uniformitarianism.

Before Hutton, no one had effectively demonstrated that geological processes could occur over long periods. Hutton convincingly argued that seemingly weak, slow-acting processes could, over extensive timescales, produce effects as significant as those resulting from sudden catastrophic events. Unlike his predecessors, Hutton supported his ideas with verifiable observations.

Although Hutton developed a comprehensive theory of uniformitarian geology, Charles Lyell became its principal advocate. Lyell successfully interpreted and publicized uniformitarianism for the wider audience. Hutton’s concept of uniformitarianism, combined with his complex and challenging literary style, did not capture the imagination of his contemporaries. As a result, geologists often credit Lyell with advancing the fundamental principles of modern geology. Lyell’s [Principles of Geology](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/33224/pg33224-images.html) is a landmark text in the history of science and is as influential to modern worldviews as the works of Charles Darwin. In 1990, the University of Chicago Press republished his works. In the first of three volumes, Charles Lyell presents the uniformitarian argument: the processes currently observable in the natural world are essentially the same as those that have acted throughout Earth's history and are sufficient to explain all geological phenomena.


## Plate Tectonics 

We live on a layer of Earth known as the lithosphere, which consists of rigid slabs that shift and slide against one another. These slabs are called tectonic plates and fit together like puzzle pieces. The movements and shifts of these plates shape our landscape, forming spectacular mountain ranges, valleys, and coastlines, mainly seen in our national parks. The theory of plate tectonics has been revolutionary in helping us understand how these landscapes were formed in the past and how they continue to change during our lifetimes.

The story of plate tectonics begins deep within the Earth. Each layer has its own unique properties and chemical composition. The thin outer layer, where we live, is divided into several plates that move relative to one another. Interactions along plate boundaries can result in earthquakes and volcanic activity, as well as the formation of mountain ranges, continents, and ocean basins.

The dramatic topography of the western United States is a result of its geological youth. Mountains and coastlines are continuously formed and deformed because they are located at or near active plate boundaries. In contrast, features in the eastern United States, such as the Appalachian Mountains and the Atlantic Coast, were created at plate boundaries long ago. Today, the nearest plate boundaries are more than a thousand miles away, and the landscapes in that region are gradually eroding.

## Rock Cycle

Rocks and minerals are all around us! They are essential for developing new technologies and have various applications in our daily lives. We use rocks and minerals in building materials, cosmetics, cars, roads, and appliances. Humans must consume minerals daily to maintain a healthy lifestyle and strengthen our bodies. Additionally, rocks and minerals play a valuable role in natural systems; for example, they provide habitats like the cliffs in Grand Canyon National Park, where endangered condors nest, and contribute nutrients to the soil in Redwoods, where the tallest trees in the world grow.

Studying rocks and minerals is essential for learning about Earth’s materials, structure, and systems. This field of study encompasses various disciplines, including earth science, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. Learners can understand crystal geometry, develop the ability to visualize three-dimensional objects, and learn about crystallization rates.

## Geologic Time

In geology, we discuss "relative time" and "absolute time" when discussing the age of geological formations or rock units. Chronostratigraphy is the branch of geology that focuses on the relationships and ages of rock units in relative time. This means that in chronostratigraphy, we are concerned with how the ages of different rock bodies relate, regardless of their specific numerical age.

Fossils offer a quick and precise way to determine the relative age of rocks within a stratigraphic sequence. However, we cannot assign an absolute age to these fossils until we have established a time scale. Geochronology is the branch of stratigraphy dedicated to dating and subdividing geological time and establishing time scales.

The time scale also indicates the onset of major evolutionary and tectonic events affecting the North American continent and the Northern Cordillera (SCAK, south-central Alaska; SEAK, southeast Alaska; NAK, northern Alaska; CAK central Alaska). Image source: [Geologic Time Scale - Geology (nps.gov)](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/geology/time-scale.htm)
```


Before geologists had the means to determine the actual ages of rocks, they based correlations on the principle of superposition, which states that older rocks are deposited before younger rocks. Geological time was divided into a hierarchy of chronostratigraphic units with unknown durations. The advent of radiometric dating techniques to ascertain the absolute ages of rocks gave rise to the discipline of geochronology and enabled the establishment of geological time scales.

No single location on Earth has experienced a continuous accumulation of sediments or rocks that can be dated to yield an ideal reference time scale. A chronostratigraphic scale is not simply discovered; it is established by consensus among numerous geologists and is based on a composite of various sections. An ideal chronostratigraphic section, which would contribute to a larger composite, would have the following attributes: a nearly continuous sequence of marine deposition; fossils that are abundant, distinctive, diverse, cosmopolitan, well-preserved, and free from significant paleoenvironmental changes; minerals suitable for isotopic age determinations; and a record of geomagnetic polarity reversals. Additionally, these ``type'' sections should be well-exposed, easily accessible, and readily correlatable to other sections.

Once a chronostratigraphic scale is agreed upon, it serves as a recognized standard that remains unchanged until it is reevaluated and modified based on better stratigraphic sections or improved analytical techniques. Consequently, no chronostratigraphic scale is ever wholly finalized.

A chronostratigraphic scale integrated with absolute ages (geochronology) is termed a geological time scale. Since Arthur Holmes published the first geological time scale in 1913, nearly two dozen time scales have been proposed. Each scale incorporated the latest standard stratigraphic sections, biostratigraphy, and age-dating developments. The most recent time scale, edited in 2004 by Felix Gradstein and colleagues, integrated high-resolution radiometric and astronomical age-dating into a comprehensive time scale covering the last 3.85 billion years (with the age of the Earth estimated at 4.54 billion years). While the 2004 time scale will likely be replaced, it currently serves as a reference standard for all geological units to be correlated and assigned an absolute age.

```

Jagged, fractured mountains, sloping streambanks, and rugged coasts are natural features shaped by water, wind, and weather over time. As these surfaces wear down, erosion carries particles away to be deposited in different locations. Some of these features are also visible in the strata of rock formations, as shown in the previous sections.

See the stream model demonstration below, which shows how erosion and sediment transport modifies stream channels and geomorphology.

## Geomorphology

Geomorphology studies the Earth's surface landforms and the processes that shape them. This field encompasses qualitative descriptions of landforms and quantitative analyses focusing on the forces acting on the Earth's surface to create and change these landforms.

To understand geomorphology, it's essential to consider the three systems that intersect at or near the Earth’s surface: 

1. **Geosphere**: This includes the rocks that make up Earth's crust and the global tectonic systems that elevate these rocks, shaping the topography.
2. **Hydrosphere**: This covers the oceans, atmosphere, and surface and subsurface waters that erode, transport, and deposit sediments.
3. **Biosphere**: This consists of living organisms within ecosystems that influence and are influenced by landscape dynamics.

Global patterns among these three fundamental systems establish broad regional templates within which geomorphological processes shape landforms and landscapes.

The landforms and topography of a region have a significant impact on a variety of catchment zone (CZ) processes. The plate tectonic setting plays a crucial role in determining the topography of a site, which in turn affects whether soils develop and accumulate or are subjected to erosion. The overall geological framework influences other environmental factors that control the CZ. 

Here are some questions to consider:

- Can unique depositional environments give rise to characteristic landforms? If so, what can these landforms reveal about CZ processes?
- Do soils that develop on unique landforms or landscape positions exhibit distinctive characteristics?
- What is the slope and aspect of a site, and how do these relate to solar heat budgets, vegetation, and CZ processes?

## Mapping Bedrock and Surficial Geology

Geologists utilize and create various types of maps to present the results of their work. Among the simplest are bedrock and surficial geology maps. Bedrock maps illustrate the different rock types found in a region. They are best understood when you envision removing all the unconsolidated sediment, soil, and vegetation from the solid rock. It's important to note that bedrock maps do not indicate a specific rock type at a particular location; instead, they show what lies beneath the subsurface soil, sediment, and vegetation. In some areas, particularly in the western United States, rocks may be visible at the surface, in which case the bedrock map reflects the rock type found there.

Surficial geologic maps, on the other hand, focus on the sediments that cover the bedrock. In some locations, there may be no sediment; thus, the surficial map will reveal the underlying bedrock. However, surficial geologic maps distinguish between the various materials brought into the region by glaciation in northeastern and northwestern Pennsylvania, where multiple glaciers deposited sediment over the past several hundred thousand years. They may even identify deposits from different ice ages.
