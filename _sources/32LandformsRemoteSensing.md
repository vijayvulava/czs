# 3.2 Landforms and Remote Sensing

One of the most remarkable aspects of Earth's surface is the infinite variety of landforms. Each landform possesses unique characteristics that differentiate it from others. This distinction is fundamental to [geomorphology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomorphology), which is the field-oriented study of landforms at the intersection of geology and various other disciplines that seek to understand surface processes. The applications of geomorphic knowledge are diverse, ranging from engineering projects that address the physical properties of landforms to geological studies that explore the record of past climate change as reflected in these landforms. This lack of rigid philosophical boundaries is perhaps geomorphology's greatest strength—its interdisciplinarity.

The diversity within the Critical Zone is exemplified by the distribution of soils across different landforms, which reflects varying chemical and mechanical weathering processes such as physical erosion and chemical denudation. These processes, in turn, influence the internal structure of the Critical Zone and its function as a feed-through reactor. Changes in surface area, flow paths, and the residence time of materials impact the weathering fluxes of elements and nutrients.

Consider the relationship between the Critical Zone as a feed-through reactor and [isostasy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isostasy). In a mountainous region where active erosion constantly removes weathered material from the summits, the unloading of this material enables the underlying crust to adjust through uplift. This process physically raises unweathered rock into the feed-through reactor. Over time, the landscape may evolve with low topography and minimal relief as the deep crustal root becomes exposed, weathered, and reaches isostatic equilibrium with the underlying mantle. Consequently, thick soil profiles develop, covering the unweathered rock and slowing the rate at which this rock is processed through the reactor.

Topography, defined by the configuration of the land surface in terms of elevation, slope, and variations in landscape position, can accelerate or decelerate the effects of climate on parent material weathering by balancing erosion and pedogenesis. Since topography often reflects the distribution of different parent materials across many landscapes, detailed soil maps can aid in interpreting geological features, and in some cases, geological maps can be derived directly from soil maps. Mappable soil bodies typically exhibit patterns of distribution based on the underlying bedrock and landforms. An in-depth assessment of geomorphic settings is essential to fully understand the Critical Zone and its soils.

The goals of this module are:
1. to further introduce the geological processes that control the development, architecture and many processes in the CZ; and,
2. to assess readily available remote sensing and aerial photography products to begin to learn to interpret landforms in the CZ.

## Soil Catena

A [soil catena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catena_(soil)) is a sequence of distinct but co-evolving soils arranged down a slope, all occurring within the same climate and on the same underlying parent material. The variation in soil types arises from precipitation, infiltration, runoff, and slope gradient. Each soil type exhibits slight differences from its neighboring soils, and a mature catena achieves equilibrium when deposition and erosion processes are balanced. 

The soil across a hillside is rarely uniform; factors like soil erosion, accumulation, and water drainage contribute to the development of different soil types from the hilltop to the valley floor. Understanding the concept of a soil catena is crucial for comprehending soil variation over small areas, such as a slope, and it aids in mapping soils across a specific region. This concept is also valuable for studying the influence of soil hydrology on soil formation and for analyzing the regular variations of soils found along a slope. The differences in soil profiles encountered down a slope are primarily the result of changes in slope gradient, soil erosion, accumulation, and water drainage.

Module Goals:

The objectives of this module are to:  
1. Provide a deeper understanding of the geological processes that shape the development, structure, and various functions of the critical zone (CZ).  
2. Evaluate readily available remote sensing and aerial photography products to improve the interpretation of landforms within the CZ.

## Types of Landforms

### Fluvial Landforms
Fluvial systems are primarily composed of rivers and streams. Stream erosion is one of the most significant geomorphic processes. These fluvial processes shape the landscape by eroding landforms, transporting sediment, and depositing it to create new landforms. Both human civilization and ecosystems rely heavily on fluvial systems. Rivers provide water for hydroelectric power and shipping, and they support stream-side wetlands (riparian areas), which are essential for maintaining clean water and offering rich habitats.

The drainage basin or watershed is a fundamental landscape unit in fluvial geomorphology. A drainage basin contains a primary, or trunk, river and its tributaries. Watersheds are separated from their neighbors by a divide, a high point where water flows in different directions on either side. Image source: [River Systems and Fluvial Landforms - Geology (U.S. National Park Service)](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/geology/fluvial-landforms.htm)
```

Fluvial systems create streams and shape striking landforms through their depositional habits. Fluvial deposits are sediments carried and deposited by the flowing water of a stream.

A floodplain is a relatively flat area adjacent to a river or stream. During floods, when the stream overflows its banks, water spreads out over the floodplain and deposits sediment. Through fluvial processes, streams build floodplains that can accommodate their maximum flood capacity. Depending on the geological setting, the geomorphic features of a floodplain may include natural levees, oxbow lakes, point bars, and terraces.

A meandering stream has a single channel that winds like a snake through its valley, causing the distance “as the stream flows” to be greater than “as the crow flies.” As water flows around these curves, the water on the outer edge moves faster than on the inner edge. This difference in flow creates an erosional surface on the outer edge, known as a cut bank, and a depositional surface on the inner edge, called a point bar. When the bends of two meanders meet, they can bypass the river’s curve, forming an oxbow lake, which may eventually fill with sediment.

Meanders change position by eroding sideways and slightly downstream. The sideways movement occurs because the maximum velocity of the stream shifts toward the outside of the bend, leading to erosion of the outer bank. Simultaneously, the reduced current inside the meander causes sediment, mainly sand, to be deposited. As a result, the stream moves laterally without altering the size of its channel. Due to the slope of the channel, erosion is more effective on the downstream side of a meander. Consequently, in addition to growing laterally, the bends gradually migrate down the valley.

### Eolian Landforms

Aeolian landforms are shaped by the wind, creating distinct features through sediment erosion and deposition. Some standard aeolian features include dunes, loess deposits, ventifacts, deflation hollows (or blowouts), and desert pavement.

Aeolian processes involve erosion, transportation, and sediment deposition by the wind. These processes can occur in various environments, such as coastal areas, cold and hot deserts, and agricultural fields. Key characteristics of these environments include sparse or nonexistent vegetation, a supply of fine sediment (including clay, silt, and sand), and strong winds. Aeolian processes are responsible for the mobilization of dust and the formation of dunes. They depend on other geological agents, like rivers, glaciers, and waves, to supply sediment for transport.

Dunes, which can be either active or stabilized by vegetation, are found along beaches and in arid or semi-arid regions. These dunes are mounds of loose sand created by wind and are among the most recognized aeolian features. There are various types of dunes, classified based on their shape. Most of them share a typical profile, including a long, shallow angle (the stoss side) facing the wind, a peak (the crest), and a steep leeward side.

Coastal dunes play a critical role in the health and sustainability of sandy beaches. The primary dune ridge (foredunes) is adjacent to the shoreline, while secondary dune fields may extend further inland. Dunes can form wherever aeolian processes (i.e., wind transportation) occur. They protect back-barrier environments, including human development, against severe waves, wind, and storms. Additionally, these geomorphic features offer vital habitats for various migratory birds and mammals. The vegetation on dunes is crucial for forming and stabilizing dune complexes on barrier islands. The root systems and exposed foliage help restrict sand movement around the plants, securing the dunes.

### Glacial Landforms

Glaciers are moving bodies of ice that can significantly alter entire landscapes. They shape mountains, carve valleys, and transport vast amounts of rock and sediment.

Glaciers create distinctive valleys that are steep-walled with flat bottoms. Examples of such valleys include U-shaped valleys, fjords, and hanging valleys. Cirques are bowl-shaped depressions that glaciers carve into high-elevation mountains and valley sidewalls. Features like nunataks, arêtes, and horns result from glacial erosion in areas where multiple glaciers flow in various directions. When glaciers are present, these features emerge as stark, rocky outcrops above the ice, enhancing the beauty of these rugged landscapes. Once the ice retreats, these uniquely shaped landforms provide clear evidence of past glacial movement.

Lateral and medial moraines consist of rock and debris transported by glaciers. Lateral moraines form along the sides of glaciers, while medial moraines develop at the junction where two tributary glaciers meet. Terminal and recessional moraines mark the furthest advance of a glacier—its terminus—at a specific time. The sediments produced through glacial grinding are distinctive. Glacial till contains a mixture of sediments ranging in size from tiny particles smaller than a grain of sand to large boulders. Glacial flour, the smallest sediment size, is responsible for the milky appearance of the water in rivers, streams, and lakes fed by glaciers.

Glaciers can pick up chunks of rock and transport them over long distances. When these rocks are deposited, they often end up far from their original location, outcrop, or bedrock. Such rocks are known as glacial erratics.

Glaciers move across the land and incorporate rock and sediment into the ice. These inclusions turn the glacier's base, or sole, into a coarse sandpaper-like surface capable of scratching the underlying bedrock. Over time, as the glacier flows over the rock and sediment, it leaves behind striations or striae on the rock surfaces, indicating the direction of the glacier’s movement.

### Karst Landforms

Karst is a landscape formed by the dissolution of bedrock, resulting in sinkholes, sinking streams, caves, springs, and other distinctive characteristics. This landscape is typically associated with soluble rock types like limestone, marble, and gypsum. Generally, a karst landscape develops when a significant amount of water on the surface interacts with and infiltrates the subsurface through cracks, fractures, and openings that dissolve into the bedrock. After traveling underground, sometimes for long distances, this water is discharged through springs, many of which serve as entrances to caves.

A sinkhole is a depression or hole that occurs when the land surface collapses due to the dissolution of underground bedrock or cave collapse. In urban areas, catastrophic sinkhole collapses can lead to substantial damage and even loss of life.

Karst landscapes are excellent for storing water as aquifers and provide vast amounts of clean drinking water for people, plants, and animals. Due to karst's porous (Swiss cheese-like) nature, water flows quickly through it with minimal filtration. Consequently, contaminants that enter a karst aquifer are transported rapidly, creating potential water quality issues. Approximately 20% of the United States is underlain by karst landscapes, and 40% of the groundwater used for drinking comes from these karst aquifers. Therefore, our health and safety must protect karst landscapes.

### Shoreline Landforms

The coastal environment refers to the area where land meets oceans or other large bodies of water. This includes the shallow waters where waves can move sediment and the landward areas such as beaches, cliffs, and coastal dunes influenced by waves, tides, and currents. The coastal zone can extend inland for several miles.

Various factors characterize coastal environments, including wave energy, tidal range, sediment supply, types of beach materials, the slope and width of the continental shelf, and historical geological events such as glaciation, volcanism, and plate tectonics.

The coastal zone is one of the most dynamic regions on Earth, considering that 70% of our planet is covered by water, which possesses immense energy.

## Remote Sensing

Remote sensing is the science of gathering information about the Earth's surface, atmosphere, and oceans using sensors that do not directly interact with the target area. This field relies on the interaction of electromagnetic signals with the Earth's surface and atmosphere to produce images and data, which can then be used to study the environment. Data from remote sensing can be obtained from various sources, including satellites, airplanes, and ground-based sensors.

NASA operates a fleet of Earth observation satellites that collect remote sensing data using various instruments. Here’s an overview of how this data is acquired:

1. Data Collection: The satellite orbits the Earth and gathers data through its sensors, which include cameras, spectrometers, and radar.
2. Data Transmission: The collected data is transmitted from the satellite to one of several ground stations worldwide.
3. Data Processing: The ground station processes the data and sends it to one of NASA’s multiple data centers.
4. Data Archiving and Access: The data centers process and archive the information, making it available to researchers, government agencies, and the public.

NASA has various Earth observation satellites, each equipped with unique instruments. For instance, the Landsat series, a collaborative effort between NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey, primarily collects multispectral imagery of the Earth's surface. On board several NASA satellites, the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) measures various environmental variables, such as land and ocean surface temperature, vegetation cover, and atmospheric aerosols.

In addition to these prominent instruments, NASA operates other sensors, including the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar, Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE).

Processing remote sensing data involves multiple stages to convert raw data into useful information. The general steps include:

1. Preprocessing: Calibrating the raw data and correcting for errors. For example, atmospheric correction is applied to eliminate atmospheric effects on the data, which can affect accuracy.
2. Image Enhancement: This step aims to improve visual quality and highlight important features. Techniques include contrast stretching, color balancing, and filtering.
3. Image Classification: Here, the image is divided into different classes based on the spectral signatures of the pixels. This allows for identifying various features, such as vegetation, water bodies, and urban areas. Both supervised and unsupervised classification methods are commonly used.
4. Change Detection: This process identifies changes between two or more images, useful for monitoring land use changes, natural disasters, and other environmental changes.
5. Data Fusion: This step integrates data from multiple sensors or sources to create a more comprehensive dataset, improving accuracy and providing a complete picture of the area of interest.
6. Analysis and Interpretation: The final step involves analyzing and interpreting the processed data to derive insights about the area. This may include identifying trends, patterns, and relevant agriculture, forestry, and urban planning anomalies.
The specific methods used can vary depending on the type of data and the application.
