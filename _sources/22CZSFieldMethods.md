# 2.2 Field and Lab Analyses

Studying the Critical Zone (CZ) involves exploring unique research questions, testing hypotheses, and designing experiments. A key objective for researchers is to establish common measurements that can be used to compare CZ processes and functions across various study sites. Using common measurements, the collective insights gained from the network of research efforts become more significant than the sum of their findings.

Some of the methods employed in this research include carbon isotopes, rock and soil profile weathering rates, stream discharge measurements, demographic studies, and soil carbon assessments. Additionally, research activities encompass data analysis and communication, leveraging actual data to understand CZ processes and consider human interactions within the CZ framework.

CZ scientists aim to quantify, using a shared set of measurements, the following:

1. The structure and evolution of the CZ
2. Event-based and continuous fluxes across CZ interfaces
3. Changes in budgets related to energy, water, solutes, and sediment

Below are examples of the methods used to collect various types of data.

## Land-Atmosphere Interface

Energy and materials are exchanged in various forms between the land and the atmosphere. The primary materials involved in these exchanges are carbon and water. One advanced research instrument commonly used in Critical Zone Observatories (CZOs) is the eddy covariance or flux tower.

An eddy covariance tower is an atmospheric measurement device that quantifies the exchange of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere. It typically consists of a tall tower equipped with multiple instruments, including sensors for measuring wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The data collected by an eddy flux tower provides valuable insights into the processes that control the exchange of energy, water, and carbon between the land and the atmosphere. This information is crucial for understanding the Earth's carbon cycle and the impacts of climate change.

The NSF-funded National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) has installed several eddy covariance towers across the United States. These towers are in "ecoclimatic domains," representing distinct regions characterized by different vegetation types, landforms, and ecosystem dynamics. This setup allows NEON to capture the full range of ecological and climatic diversity found in the country (see [NSF NEON | Open Data to Understand Our Ecosystems](https://www.neonscience.org/)). The data collected from these observatories is available through the [Data Portal | NSF NEON](https://www.neonscience.org/data) and can serve as an excellent supplement to data from nearby Critical Zone Observatories (CZOs).

The eddy covariance method is frequently used after a detailed landscape assessment, often involving remote sensing techniques such as LiDAR (light detection and ranging). These techniques are applicable in various fields, including archaeology, geomorphology, seismology, forestry, and self-driving vehicle technologies.

## Vegetation and Associated Microbiota

Carbon from dead, decaying animals and rotting leaves eventually enters the atmosphere. To understand this crucial carbon cycling process, we must explore three key aspects of soil: what lives in it, what it is made of, and how it behaves under different environmental conditions.

When we stand on soil, we are standing on a significant reservoir of the carbon cycle, which can release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere if global temperatures continue to rise. On the other hand, many ranchers, farmers, and soil scientists believe that soil could also help mitigate the increasing levels of atmospheric CO2.

Like oceans, soils are highly complex ecosystems where carbon interacts with other biogeochemical cycles, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. Adding to this complexity, the microbes living in the soil mediate many of these biogeochemical interactions and play a vital role in driving key carbon cycle processes.

### Carbon stored in soil

In soils, you can find carbon in both **organic carbon compounds** and **inorganic carbon compounds**. In most soils, carbon predominates as **soil organic carbon (SOC)**.

```

Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the primary component of soil organic matter (SOM). SOM is formed through the biological, chemical, and physical decay of organic materials both on the soil surface and below ground. Essentially, soil organic matter (SOM) consists of any material that was once alive, including:

- **Decomposed organic materials** from plant and animal remains in various stages of decay, as well as cells and tissues shed by soil organisms and substances derived from plant roots and soil microbes.
- **Living soil microbes**, including bacteria, fungi, archaea, nematodes, protozoa, and plant roots. When weighed together, soil microbes account for about 90-95% of the total weight of organisms found in soil.
- **Humus** is a chemically stable organic matter comprising large, complex organic carbon compounds, minerals, and soil particles. Humus resists further decomposition unless environmental conditions change. If left undisturbed, humus can store soil carbon for hundreds to thousands of years, making it a crucial carbon sink.
- **Charcoal** (biochar) is the product of partially burned plant material. This form of organic matter can remain undecomposed in the soil for decades to centuries.


### Carbon balance within the soil

In {numref}`soil-carbon-storage`, the flow of carbon into and out of the soil is shown. If plants transfer more carbon into the soil than is released via soil respiration, more carbon will get stored in the humus via the process of **humification**.

```

For many years, soil scientists and farmers have understood that carbon can remain in the soil for extended periods, particularly in carbon-rich humus. Humus is created when soil microbes break down soil organic material. However, humus is a complex substance that is not fully understood. Current research suggests that the duration for which soil carbon remains in humus and other soil organic matter (SOM) components depends on various ecosystem interactions involving SOM, microbes, minerals, moisture, and temperature. Scientists have not yet determined how long this carbon will stay stored in the soil or whether environmental disturbances will release significant amounts into the atmosphere, potentially exacerbating climate change.

## Soil and Vadose Zone

The solid and unsaturated phases (vadose zone) within soils provide essential information about the composition of the soil and its specific functions within the groundwater zone (CZ). The soil pit in the video below illustrates the vadose zone and the CZ.

## Saprolite and Bedrock

During the process of soil formation, bedrock weathers into regolith, which consists of weathered rock, saprolite, and soil. As this transformation occurs, porosity increases, facilitating fluid flow and releasing nutrients from the minerals present. However, these essential processes, particularly in deep regolith, are poorly understood due to the challenges of making direct observations in these areas. This is where previously mentioned geophysical techniques become valuable.

Hollow-bore coring of bedrock enables the collection of rock and regolith samples, essential for studying this part of the critical zone (CZ). Analyzing these samples provides valuable insights into various characteristics, such as porosity, permeability, fractures, faults, and mineralogy.

## Surface water

Natural streams and irrigation channels carry water across diverse landscapes. Various methods and infrastructures are commonly employed to monitor and control stream behavior.

The US Geological Survey (USGS) maintains an extensive network of stream monitoring stations throughout many stream systems in the United States. These monitoring efforts include measuring stream levels and discharge, assessing meteorological conditions, monitoring groundwater, and analyzing water chemistry and health. In addition to providing information about water quantity and quality, the USGS also offers updates on flood status and availability.

```{admonition} Mini-Project #3

**Part A:**

Complete an annotated bibliography of the research topic you selected. Your bibliography should include the following:

(1) Select a general, CZ-related topic you want to investigate. This topic should be in the form of a question. For example, a reasonable question could be, “How does vegetation affect soil formation in different ecosystems?”

(2) Once you have selected a topic, you should find **five** research articles that relate to your chosen topic. Once you have settled on the most appropriate sources that relate to your topic, you should complete these tasks for each of the five sources only where they relate directly to your topic:

- List the sources as you would in a bibliography using a consistent format such as the Chicago Manual of Style format.
- Identify and list the related research question(s) the author(s) are investigating.
- Identify the related methods used to investigate the question and how those methods relate to your research question.
- Identify the type of data the authors generated and how they interpreted them. Identify what relevant conclusions the authors drew from their data.
    

(3) After completing this analysis, refine your research question. For example, based on the question above, you might ask: “How does vegetation litter affect the base status of soils in high-elevation coniferous forests?”

**Part B:**

Visit your assigned CZO site, select, and download a time series of data collected at this site.  Typically, they are available for a stream site.

Use this link to go to your site and filter the different types of data available: [CUAHSI HydroClient](https://data.cuahsi.org/)

Using data from the CZO database, produce:

- A simple line graph with a best-fit slope trendline and the equation of slope
- A bar graph with a paired data set that calculates and plots the average and standard deviation.
- An XY graph with an appropriate trendline
- A data histogram

Each graph should be laid out and labeled. Each data set should be at least 48 rows. Briefly summarize the source of the data, what your graph illustrates, and what insight your graphical analysis has given you.
