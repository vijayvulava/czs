# 4.2 Carbon Budget

We will analyze carbon flux data collected at various scales to understand the regional carbon exchange at an Ameriflux or Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) site. This analysis addresses the significant challenge of understanding atmospheric gases and the biogeochemical/carbon cycle. Additionally, this unit connects to the geoscience literacy themes of Earth system changes that occur at multiple scales and the interconnections between carbon, energy, and water cycles.

You will:
- Use a carbon cycle diagram to discuss the different carbon pathways at a watershed scale.
- Contrast global carbon budgets with biome-specific ones to enhance your understanding of watershed-scale processes.
- Relate carbon flux data collected at various scales to understand the regional carbon exchange at an Ameriflux site.
- Explore and visualize carbon flux data from the Ameriflux database.
- Use carbon flux data from the Ameriflux database to support a simple hypothesis that relates carbon flux to driving environmental variables.

## Carbon Cycle

Carbon is the foundation of all life on Earth, as it is essential for forming complex molecules like proteins and DNA. This element is also present in our atmosphere as carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO2}$). Carbon helps regulate the Earth’s temperature, supports all life, serves as a key ingredient in the food that sustains us, and is a major energy source that fuels our global economy.

The carbon cycle describes the continuous movement of carbon atoms between the atmosphere and the Earth. Since our planet and its atmosphere form a closed system, the total amount of carbon does not change. However, the location of carbon—whether in the atmosphere or within the Earth—is constantly shifting.

On Earth, most carbon is stored in rocks and sediments, while the rest is found in the oceans, atmosphere, and living organisms. These are known as reservoirs or sinks through which carbon cycles.

Carbon is released back into the atmosphere through various processes, such as when organisms die, volcanoes erupt, wildfires occur, or fossil fuels are burned.

Carbon is continually exchanged between the surface waters and the atmosphere in the oceans, or it can be stored for long periods in the ocean depths.

Humans significantly impact the carbon cycle through activities such as burning fossil fuels and land development, which result in a rapid increase in $\ce{CO2}$ levels in the atmosphere.

## Carbon Budget

Energy flow refers to the movement of energy through an ecosystem, starting from an external source (the Sun), passing through various organisms, and returning to the external environment (space). This process is fundamental to all ecosystems.

In ecosystems, energy flow sets living systems apart from the rest of the universe. All forms of life require energy. Our body mass reflects a delicate balance between the energy we consume through food and the energy we expend through various activities; any excess energy is stored. This principle applies to humans and other organisms, populations, communities, ecosystems, biomes, and the biosphere.

Two aspects are essential to understanding the role of energy in ecosystems fully. The first is the function of energy in living systems, particularly its role in producing organic matter. This information can help us understand the ultimate limits on the abundance of life. The second aspect concerns the pathways through which energy flows, the efficiency of its use, and its role in the various life processes.

### Photosynthesis

The primary function of energy in a life-supporting system is to enable the production of organic matter. The amount of usable energy in a system sets an upper limit on the quantity of organic matter and, consequently, the amount of life that any ecosystem can sustain and, ultimately, by the Earth.

Photosynthesis is the only biological process capable of capturing energy from sunlight and converting it into chemical compounds (carbohydrates) that every organism uses to fuel its metabolism. It also produces oxygen, which is essential for many living organisms. In short, sunlight energy is "captured" to energize electrons, which are stored in the covalent bonds of sugar molecules.

Plants, algae, and a type of bacteria called cyanobacteria are the only organisms that perform photosynthesis. Since they use light to create food, they are called *photoautotrophs* (literally, "self-feeders using light"). In contrast, other organisms, such as animals, fungi, and most bacteria, are termed *heterotrophs* ("other feeders"), as they rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs. A small group of bacteria synthesize sugars without using sunlight's energy; these are known as *chemoautotrophs*.

Photosynthesis is a multi-step process that requires specific wavelengths of visible sunlight, carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO2}$, which is low in energy), and water ($\ce{H2O}$) as substrates. It releases oxygen ($\ce{O2}$) upon completing the process. It produces simple carbohydrate molecules (high in energy) that can be converted into glucose, sucrose, or other sugar molecules. These sugar molecules contain the energy and energized carbon all living things need to survive.

$$

$$

The total amount of organic matter on Earth, or within any specific ecosystem, is called the biomass of that system. This biomass includes all living organisms as well as the byproducts of these organisms. Since most life exists on or near Earth’s surface, biomass is typically measured as an amount per unit of surface area.

Primary producers convert energy and inorganic compounds into biomass, which takes the form of carbon-based organic compounds. The biomass production and its subsequent use as an energy source by autotrophs involves three key steps. First, the autotrophic organism synthesizes organic matter within its body, primarily through photosynthesis and, less commonly, through chemosynthesis. Next, some of this newly produced organic matter is utilized as fuel for metabolism and respiration, releasing energy back into the surrounding environment as heat. Finally, a portion of the freshly produced organic matter is stored for future use, also in the form of carbon-based compounds.

The first step, producing organic matter before any consumption occurs, is known as gross production. The biomass that remains after gross production once used to support life processes (the second step), is called net production.

$$
NPP = GPP – Re
$$
where, $NPP$ is net primary production, $GPP$ is gross primary production and $Re$ is  respiration. This is a fundamental production relationship. 


### Respiration

Carbohydrates produced during photosynthesis are valuable to a plant when converted into energy. This energy is essential for cell growth and the development of new tissues. The chemical process that transforms sugars and starches into energy is known as oxidation, similar to burning wood or coal to generate heat.

Organisms that obtain food energy by feeding on other organisms or organic compounds they produce are called heterotrophs. When heterotrophs consume another organism, the energy stored in the organic compounds is released through one of two metabolic processes. Organisms that cannot tolerate oxygen derive their energy through anaerobic fermentation, where carbohydrate molecules partially decompose to produce alcohol, carbon dioxide, and water while releasing energy. On the other hand, heterotrophs that can tolerate oxygen extract their energy through the aerobic process known as respiration (or cellular respiration). This process uses oxygen to break down carbohydrates, releasing carbon dioxide, water, and energy. Respiration is significantly more efficient than fermentation as a metabolic process.

$$
\ce{O2 + Sugars -> Alcohols + CO2 + H2O + Energy}
$$


### Allocation

The process of dividing the primary products of photosynthesis into various functional groups is known as carbon (C) allocation. Several conceptual frameworks established decades ago describe plant allocation strategies as a balance between the biomass of aboveground and belowground organs. Additionally, allocation can be seen as a trade-off in resource distribution among different functional needs, such as growth and defense, particularly in the presence of herbivores and pathogens.

```

Carbon allocation depends on the ecosystem type, its components, and their interactions. Carbon allocation to plant biomass can be shown as 

$$\frac{dC_{biomass}}{dt} = α_{biomass} \times NPP$$
Where:

- $\frac{dC_{biomass}}{dt}$ is the rate of change in plant biomass carbon stock
- $α_{biomass}$ is the fraction of $NPP$ allocated to plant biomass growth

Environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric concentrations of $\ce{CO2}$ and ozone significantly impact plant processes. They can affect plants directly, for example, through heat damage or indirectly by influencing the availability of carbohydrates, such as by reducing photosynthetic rates. In response to changes in environmental conditions, plants adjust how they allocate available carbon among different organs (such as prioritizing aboveground versus belowground growth or reproduction) and functional metabolites (for instance, choosing between synthesizing cellulose for growth and producing defensive compounds). These plant responses define their allocation strategies, many of which remain poorly understood in the context of climate change.

### Controls on *NPP* 

The main controls on $NPP$ can be categorized into environmental and biological factors.

**Environmental Factors**:

1. Light availability: Photosynthesis is driven by the energy from sunlight, so the amount of available light is a critical factor for $NPP$. Light availability is influenced by latitude, season, cloud cover, and forest canopy structure.
2. Temperature: Photosynthesis and respiration rates are temperature-dependent, with an optimum range for most plant species. Temperatures that are too low or too high can limit $NPP$.
3. Water availability: Water is essential for photosynthesis and plant growth. Drought conditions can severely limit $NPP$, while excessive water can also be detrimental.
4. Nutrient availability: Plants require nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium for growth and development. Nutrient limitations in the soil can constrain $NPP$.
5. $\ce{CO2}$ concentration: Higher atmospheric $\ce{CO2}$ concentrations can increase photosynthetic rates and potentially boost $NPP$, although other factors may limit the response.

**Biological Factors**:

1. Plant species composition: Different plants have varying photosynthetic efficiencies, growth rates, and resource requirements, which can influence $NPP$ at the ecosystem level.
2. Plant functional traits: Traits such as leaf area, leaf lifespan, root architecture, and wood density can affect the efficiency of resource acquisition and utilization, impacting $NPP$.
3. Plant age and development: $NPP$ generally increases as plants mature, reaches a maximum at an intermediate age, and then declines as plants senesce.
4. Herbivory and disturbances: Herbivores consuming plant biomass, as well as disturbances like fires, storms, and human activities, can reduce $NPP$.
5. Competition and facilitation: Interactions between plants, such as competition for resources or facilitative effects, can influence NPP at the community level.

These environmental and biological factors interact in complex ways to determine the overall $NPP$ of an ecosystem. Changes in these factors, such as those driven by climate change or land-use practices, can significantly impact terrestrial ecosystems' carbon cycling and productivity.

### Carbon Relationships 

The main equations that cover the carbon budget on Earth (or the CZ) involve tracking the exchange of carbon between different reservoirs or pools, including the atmosphere, terrestrial biosphere (plants and soils), oceans, and geological reservoirs (fossil fuels and sedimentary rocks). Some pools (e.g., oceans) do not apply in the CZ context.

Here are some of the key equations used to quantify the carbon budget:

1. Atmospheric Carbon Balance:  
   
   $$\frac{dC_{atm}}{dt} = E_{ff} + E_{luc} - S_{ocean} - S_{land}$$
    Where:
    - $\frac{dC_{atm}}{dt}$ is the rate of change in atmospheric carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO2}$) concentration
    - $E_{ff}$ is the emission from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes
    - $E_{luc}$ is the emission from land-use change (e.g., deforestation)
    - $S_{ocean}$ is the uptake of carbon by the oceans
    - $S_{land}$ is the uptake of carbon by terrestrial ecosystems

2. Ocean Carbon Uptake: 
   
   $$S_{ocean} = k_g \times (p\ce{CO2}_{,atm} - p\ce{CO2}_{, ocean})$$
    Where:
    - $k_g$ is the gas transfer coefficient
    - $p\ce{CO2}_{, atm}$ is the partial pressure of $\ce{CO2}$ in the atmosphere
    - $p\ce{CO2}_{, ocean}$ is the partial pressure of $\ce{CO2}$ in the ocean surface waters

3. Terrestrial Biosphere Carbon Uptake: 
   
   $$S_{land} = NPP - R_h - D$$
    Where:
    - $NPP$ is the net primary production (the amount of carbon fixed by plants through photosynthesis)
    - $R_h$ is the heterotrophic respiration (the release of carbon from the decomposition of organic matter)
    - $D$ is the disturbance flux (e.g., fires, deforestation)

4. Geological Carbon Reservoir Balance: 
   
   $$\frac{dC_{geo}}{dt} = F_{burial} - F_{weathering} - E_{ff}$$
    Where:
    - $\frac{dC_{geo}}{dt}$ is the rate of change in the geological carbon reservoir
    - $F_{burial}$ is the flux of carbon burial in sedimentary rocks
    - $F_{weathering}$ is the flux of carbon release through rock weathering processes
    - $E_{ff}$ is the emission from fossil fuel combustion

5. Climate-Carbon Cycle Feedback Relationship: 
   
   $$\begin{align}
   NPP &= f(T, P, \ce{CO2}) \\
   R_h &= g(T, P, \ce{CO2})
   \end{align}$$
    Where:
	- $NPP$ and $R_h$ are functions of temperature ($T$), precipitation ($P$), and atmospheric $\ce{CO2}$ concentration
	- $f$ and $g$ represent the functional relationships between these variables and the carbon fluxes
