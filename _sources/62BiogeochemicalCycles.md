# 6.2 Biogeochemical Cycles

Biogeochemical cycles refer to the pathways through which essential elements, such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P), circulate in Earth's ecosystems. These cycles involve the interplay of biological, geological, and chemical processes that facilitate the transfer of these materials between living organisms and their environments. Key processes within these cycles include photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, weathering, and the uptake and release of nutrients by plants and animals.

These biogeochemical cycles are crucial for maintaining the balance of essential elements and compounds in ecosystems. However, human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and pollution can significantly disrupt these cycles, impacting the health and functioning of ecosystems.

## The Carbon Cycle

The carbon cycle describes the movement of carbon between the atmosphere, oceans, land, and living organisms. It includes biotic and abiotic processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, and carbon dioxide exchange between the atmosphere and oceans.

$\ce{CO2}$ gas exists in the atmosphere and is dissolved in water. Photosynthesis converts $\ce{CO2}$ gas to organic carbon, and respiration cycles the organic carbon back into $\ce{CO2}$ gas. Long-term organic carbon storage occurs when matter from living organisms is buried deep underground and fossilized. Volcanic activity and, more recently, human emissions bring this stored carbon back into the carbon cycle.

```

The $\ce{C}$ cycle is most easily studied as two interconnected subcycles: one dealing with rapid carbon exchange among living organisms and the other dealing with the long-term cycling of carbon through geologic processes.


### The Biological Carbon Cycle

Living organisms are interconnected in numerous ways, including across different ecosystems. A prime example of this connection is the exchange of carbon ($\ce{C}$) between heterotrophs and autotrophs, facilitated by atmospheric carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO2}$). Autotrophs utilize $\ce{CO2}$ as a fundamental building block to create multi-carbon, high-energy compounds like glucose. These organisms harness energy from the Sun to form the covalent bonds that link carbon atoms together, storing this energy for later use in processes such as respiration. 

Most terrestrial autotrophs directly obtain $\ce{CO2}$ from the atmosphere, while marine autotrophs acquire it in dissolved forms, such as bicarbonate ($\ce{HCO3-}$). Regardless of the method of acquisition, a byproduct of carbon fixation in these organic compounds is oxygen ($\ce{O2}$). Photosynthetic organisms are responsible for maintaining approximately 21% of the oxygen content in the atmosphere that we observe today.

In this biological carbon exchange, heterotrophs—particularly primary consumers like herbivores—play a crucial role. Heterotrophs obtain high-energy carbon compounds by consuming autotrophs and breaking them down through respiration to generate cellular energy, such as ATP. Aerobic respiration is the most efficient form of respiration, which requires oxygen from the atmosphere or dissolved in water. Consequently, there is a continuous exchange of $\ce{O2}$ and $\ce{CO2}$ between autotrophs, which need carbon, and heterotrophs, which require oxygen. 

Autotrophs also engage in respiration, consuming the organic molecules they produce. They utilize $\ce{O2}$ and release $\ce{CO2}$. However, they produce more oxygen as a waste product of photosynthesis than they consume for respiration. This surplus oxygen is available for the respiration of other aerobic organisms. Gas exchange through the atmosphere and water is one of the key ways the carbon cycle connects all living organisms on Earth.


### The Biogeochemical Carbon Cycle

The movement of carbon through land, water, and air is complex and, in many cases, occurs much more slowly on geological timescales than the movement between living organisms. Carbon is stored for long periods in what are known as carbon reservoirs. These include the atmosphere, bodies of liquid water (mostly oceans), ocean sediments, soil, rocks (including fossil fuels), and Earth’s interior.

The atmosphere serves as a major carbon reservoir, primarily in the form of carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO2}$), which is essential for the process of photosynthesis. The levels of $\ce{CO2}$ in the atmosphere are significantly influenced by the carbon stored in the oceans. The carbon exchange between the atmosphere and water reservoirs affects how much carbon is found in each, creating a reciprocal relationship. Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere dissolves in water and, unlike oxygen and nitrogen gas, reacts with water molecules to form ionic compounds. Some of these ions combine with $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ in seawater to form calcium carbonate ($\ce{CaCO3}$), a significant component of marine organisms' shells. Over geologic time, $\ce{CaCO3}$ accumulates to form limestone, the largest carbon reservoir on Earth.

On land, carbon is stored in the soil as organic carbon, resulting from the decomposition of living organisms and the weathering of terrestrial rocks and minerals. Beneath the surface, both on land and at sea, fossil fuels are formed from the anaerobic decomposition of plant remains over millions of years. Fossil fuels are considered non-renewable because their consumption far exceeds their formation rate. A non-renewable resource is regenerated very slowly or not at all. Carbon can also enter the atmosphere from land (including the seabed) through volcanic eruptions and other geothermal processes. Carbon sediments from the ocean floor are transported deep within Earth by subduction, the movement of one tectonic plate beneath another. Carbon is released as $\ce{CO2}$ during volcanic eruptions or from hydrothermal vents.

Additionally, human practices in animal husbandry add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The large number of livestock raised to feed Earth’s growing human population contributes to increased $\ce{CO2}$ levels resulting from their respiration. This exemplifies how human activities indirectly impact biogeochemical cycles in significant ways. While much of the debate regarding the future effects of increasing atmospheric carbon on climate change centers on fossil fuels, scientists consider natural processes—such as volcanic activity, plant growth, soil carbon levels, and respiration—when modeling and predicting the future impacts of rising $\ce{CO2}$ levels.

## The Nitrogen Cycle

The nitrogen cycle is the biogeochemical process through which nitrogen ($\ce{N}$) is transformed into various chemical forms as it moves through the biosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. The primary forms of nitrogen include gaseous dinitrogen ($\ce{N2}$), ammonia ($\ce{NH3}$), ammonium ($\ce{NH4+}$), and nitrate ($\ce{NO3−}$).
```{figure} https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20230220.155442/resources/fcd7625eabb80c9af5a289cf8b2ea6389950c9a1

Nitrogen enters the living world from the atmosphere through nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This nitrogen and nitrogenous waste from animals is then processed back into gaseous nitrogen by soil bacteria, which also supply terrestrial food webs with the organic nitrogen they need.

Image source: [20.2 Biogeochemical Cycles - Concepts of Biology | OpenStax](https://openstax.org/books/concepts-biology/pages/20-2-biogeochemical-cycles)
```

Getting nitrogen into the living world is a challenging process. Plants and phytoplankton cannot directly utilize nitrogen from the atmosphere, which exists as the tightly bonded, triple covalent molecule $\ce{N2}$. Despite comprising approximately 78% of the atmosphere, this gaseous nitrogen needs to be processed to be helpful in living organisms. Nitrogen enters the biosphere primarily through free-living and symbiotic bacteria that incorporate nitrogen into their macromolecules via nitrogen fixation, which converts $\ce{N2}$ into a usable form.

Cyanobacteria, which inhabit most sunlight-rich aquatic ecosystems, play a critical role in this nitrogen fixation process. They can utilize inorganic nitrogen sources to "fix" nitrogen. Additionally, the bacteria known as _Rhizobium_ live symbiotically in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, beans, and peanuts) and supply these plants with the organic nitrogen they require. Free-living bacteria like _Azotobacter_ are also significant contributors to nitrogen fixation.

Organic nitrogen is vital for understanding ecosystem dynamics, as many ecosystem processes, including primary production and decomposition, are limited by nitrogen availability. Once nitrogen is fixed into living organisms, it eventually undergoes conversion back into nitrogen gas through the actions of bacteria in a series of steps in terrestrial systems: ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. The process begins with ammonification, where specific bacteria and fungi convert nitrogenous waste from living animals or decaying organisms into ammonium ($\ce{NH4+}$). Next, nitrifying bacteria, such as _Nitrosomonas_, convert this ammonium into nitrites ($\ce{NO2−}$) through nitrification. Subsequently, similar bacteria transform these nitrites into nitrates ($\ce{NO3-}$). Finally, denitrification occurs, where bacteria such as _Pseudomonas_ and _Clostridium_ convert nitrates into nitrogen gas, allowing them to re-enter the atmosphere.

Human activities can also introduce nitrogen into the environment, mainly through the combustion of fossil fuels, which releases various nitrogen oxides, and the application of artificial fertilizers that contain nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in agriculture. These fertilizers can wash into lakes, streams, and rivers due to surface runoff. Atmospheric nitrogen (aside from $\ce{N2}$) is linked to several ecological effects, including the formation of acid rain (as nitric acid, $\ce{HNO3}$) and greenhouse gas effects (as nitrous oxide, $\ce{N2O}$), which could contribute to climate change. A significant consequence of fertilizer runoff is the process of eutrophication in both freshwater and saltwater systems, wherein nutrient over-enrichment leads to excessive algae growth, causing a range of environmental problems.

In the marine nitrogen cycle, a similar set of processes—ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification—takes place and is conducted by marine bacteria and archaea. Some of this nitrogen ultimately settles on the ocean floor as sediment, which may be transferred to land over geological time due to the uplift of Earth’s surface, thereby becoming part of terrestrial rock. Although the direct movement of nitrogen from rocks into living systems has traditionally been viewed as insignificant compared to atmospheric nitrogen fixation, recent studies suggest that this process may be significant and should be included in any comprehensive analysis of the global nitrogen cycle.

## The Phosphorus Cycle

Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for living processes; it is a significant component of nucleic acids and phospholipids and, as calcium phosphate, makes up the supportive components of our bones. Phosphorus is often the limiting nutrient (necessary for growth) in aquatic, particularly freshwater, ecosystems.

<div class="container">

</div>

Phosphorus occurs naturally as the phosphate ion ($\ce{PO4^3-}$). In addition to human activities, natural surface runoff occurs when phosphates are leached from phosphate-containing rocks due to weathering, sending these phosphates into rivers, lakes, and oceans. These rocks have origins in the ocean, where phosphate-containing sediments primarily form from the bodies and excretions of marine organisms. Additionally, volcanic ash, aerosols, and mineral dust can contribute significantly to $\ce{PO4^3-}$ sources. Over geological time, this sediment is transported to land by uplifting the Earth's surface.

Phosphorus is also exchanged between $\ce{PO4^3-}$ dissolved in the ocean and marine organisms. The movement of $\ce{PO4^3-}$ from the ocean to land and through soil is extremely slow, with an average oceanic residence time of $\ce{PO4^3-}$ ranging between 20,000 and 100,000 years.

The phosphorus cycle is relatively slow, taking millions of years to move from one reservoir to another. The main reservoirs of phosphorus include rocks, sediments, soil, and living organisms. Most phosphorus in nature exists in the form of $\ce{PO4^3−}$.

In nature, phosphorus exists as the phosphate ion ($\ce{PO4^3-}$). Weathering of rocks and volcanic activity releases phosphate into the soil, water, and air, where it becomes available to terrestrial food webs. Phosphate enters the oceans through surface runoff, groundwater, and river flow. Phosphate dissolved in ocean water cycles into marine food webs. Some phosphate from the marine food webs falls to the ocean floor, forming sediment.

Excess phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) entering ecosystems from fertilizer runoff and sewage lead to excessive algae growth. When these algae die and decay, they deplete dissolved oxygen ($\ce{O2}$) in the water, resulting in the death of aquatic organisms, such as shellfish and finfish. This process contributes to the formation of dead zones in lakes and at the mouths of major rivers, resulting in massive fish kills, particularly during the summer months.

The size and number of marine dead zones—areas where the deep water is so low in dissolved oxygen that sea creatures can’t survive—have grown explosively in the past half-century. Yellow circles on this map show the location of observed eutrophic zones. Red dots show where hypoxic zones have been observed. It’s no coincidence that dead zones occur downriver of places where land is intensively used for agriculture. Some fertilizer we apply to crops is washed into streams and rivers. Fertilizer-laden runoff triggers explosive planktonic algae growth in coastal areas. The algae die and rain down into deep waters, where their remains are like fertilizer for microbes. The microbes decompose the organic matter, using up the oxygen. Mass killing of fish and other sea life often results. Satellites can observe changes in how the ocean surface reflects and absorbs sunlight when the water holds a lot of particles of organic matter. Darker blues in this image show higher concentrations of particulate organic matter, indicating the overly fertile waters that can culminate in dead zones.

A dead zone is an area in lakes and oceans near the mouths of rivers where large regions are periodically depleted of their normal flora and fauna; these zones can be caused by eutrophication, oil spills, dumping of toxic chemicals, and other human activities. The number of dead zones has increased for several years, and more than 400 of these zones were present as of 2008. One of the worst dead zones is off the coast of the United States in the Gulf of Mexico: fertilizer runoff from the Mississippi River basin created a dead zone of over 8,463 square miles. Phosphate and nitrate runoff from fertilizers also negatively affect several lake and bay ecosystems, including the Chesapeake Bay in the eastern United States.

## Nutrient Pollution

Nutrient pollution is the addition of excess nutrients, mainly nitrogen and phosphorus, into the water or air.

According to US EPA, "nutrient pollution is one of America's most widespread, costly and challenging environmental problems.” ([Nutrient Pollution | US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution))

Nitrogen and phosphorus are natural nutrients found in aquatic ecosystems. Nitrogen is the most abundant element in the air we breathe. Both nitrogen and phosphorus support the growth of algae and aquatic plants, which provide food and habitat for fish, shellfish, and smaller organisms living in water.

However, when excessive amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus enter the environment—often due to various human activities—air and water can become polluted. Over the past several decades, nutrient pollution has affected many streams, rivers, lakes, bays, and coastal waters, leading to serious environmental and human health issues and economic impacts.

An overabundance of nitrogen and phosphorus in water leads to accelerated algae growth, which can overwhelm ecosystems. Significant increases in algae harm water quality, disrupt food resources and habitats, and decrease the oxygen needed for fish and other aquatic life to survive. Large algae outbreaks are known as algal blooms, which can drastically reduce or eliminate oxygen in the water, causing illnesses in fish and resulting in significant fish die-offs. Some algal blooms produce harmful toxins and encourage bacterial growth, posing health risks to humans through contact with contaminated water, consuming tainted fish or shellfish, or drinking polluted water.

Nutrient pollution in groundwater—used as a drinking water source by millions of people in the United States—can be harmful even at low levels. Infants are particularly vulnerable to a nitrogen-based compound called nitrates found in drinking water. Excess nitrogen in the atmosphere can create pollutants such as ammonia and ozone, impairing respiratory health, limiting visibility, and disrupting plant growth. When excess nitrogen falls back to Earth from the atmosphere, it can negatively affect the health of forests, soils, and waterways.

The primary sources of excess nitrogen and phosphorus are:
- [Agriculture](https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/sources-and-solutions-agriculture): The nitrogen and phosphorus in animal manure and chemical fertilizers are necessary to grow crops. However, when plants do not fully utilize these nutrients they can be lost from the farm fields and negatively impact air and downstream water quality.
- [Stormwater](https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/sources-and-solutions-stormwater): When precipitation falls on our cities and towns, it runs across hard surfaces - like rooftops, sidewalks, and roads - and carries pollutants, including nitrogen and phosphorus, into local waterways.
- [Wastewater](https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/sources-and-solutions-wastewater): Our sewer and septic systems are responsible for treating large quantities of waste, and these systems do not always operate properly or remove enough nitrogen and phosphorus before discharging into waterways.
- [Fossil Fuels](https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/sources-and-solutions-fossil-fuels): Electric power generation, industry, transportation, and agriculture have increased the amount of nitrogen in the air through the use of fossil fuels.
- [In and Around the Home](https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/sources-and-solutions-and-around-home): Fertilizers, yard and pet waste, and certain soaps and detergents contain nitrogen and phosphorus and can contribute to nutrient pollution if not properly used or disposed of. The amount of hard surfaces and landscaping type can also increase nitrogen and phosphorus runoff during wet weather.

Excess nutrients in air and water can affect human health, the environment, and the economy. Federal, state, and local governments spend billions annually to minimize these effects.
